The past decade has seen a rapid increase in the adoption of building information modeling (BIM). BIM allows project stakeholders to more effectively define, communicate, and address issues. Yet there are areas in the construction industry not yet taking advantage of the full potential of BIM. For example, the building code development and compliance checking process has yet to be integrated with BIM on a large scale. Numerous attempts have been made to automate code compliance indicating that automation is an aspiration in the industry. One impetus for this movement is that previous and current processes surrounding development of and compliance with building codes and design standards has become increasingly cumbersome over the past three decades. Recent improvements in processing power have allowed advances in BIM technology using machine learning. In an industry that is seeking ways to increase productivity, changing the current code development and compliance checking processes by incorporating BIM and machine learning would have a significantly positive impact on the industry. This paper examines issues around transformation of the code development and compliance process.

Integrating semantic NLP and logic reasoning into a unified system for fully-automated code checking	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Automated code checking; Automated information extraction; Automated reasoning; Building information modeling (BIM); Natural language processing; Logic; Semantic systems; Automated construction management systems	CONSTRUCTION; ONTOLOGY; EXPRESS; IFCOWL; BIM	Existing automated compliance checking (ACC) systems are limited in their automation; they rely on the use of hard-coded, proprietary rules for representing regulatory requirements, which requires major manual effort in extracting regulatory information from textual regulatory documents and coding these information into a rule format. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a new unified ACC system that integrates: (1) semantic natural language processing techniques and EXPRESS data-based techniques to automatically extract and transform both regulatory information (in regulatory documents) and design information [in building information models (BIMs)] for automated compliance reasoning, and (2) semantic logic-based information representation so that the reasoning could be fully automated. To test the proposed system, a BIM test case was checked for compliance with Chapter 19 of the International Building Code 2009. Comparing to a manually-developed gold standard, 98.7% recall and 87.6% precision in noncompliance detection were achieved. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This makes compliance documentation and evaluation a tedious and error prone process. In energy efficiency domain, some energy simulation tools facilitate compliance automation, but there are none for current Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC). Since legislation mandates ECBC Compliance in several states in India, bridging this gap is essential. This paper demonstrates Baseline Automation for ECBC (2017). The approach translates the Proposed Design Simulation Input Definition File (IDF) into a Baseline Case IDF using a Python based scripting language (Eppy). This automation serves as a productivity measure that frees up the energy modeler's time for pursuing useful design improvements.

The automated procedure proposed in this paper is based on the object-oriented (00) representations for both building design and building code. These 00 representation models fully support the execution of building compliance checking automatically. A prototype in Java on Windows NT has been developed to implement our approaches presented in this paper.

Semantic-Based Logic Representation and Reasoning for Automated Regulatory Compliance Checking	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Automated compliance checking; Automated reasoning; First-order logic; Logic programming; Semantic systems; Automated construction management systems		Existing automated compliance checking (ACC) efforts are limited in their automation and reasoning capabilities; the state of the art in ACC still uses ad hoc reasoning schema/methods, with lack of support for complete automation in ACC reasoning. First-order logic (FOL) representation and reasoning can provide a generalized reasoning method to facilitate complete automation in ACC reasoning. This paper presents a new FOL-based information representation and compliance reasoning (IRep and CR) schema for representing and reasoning about regulatory information and design information for checking regulatory compliance of building designs. The schema formalizes the representation of regulatory information and design information in the form of semantic-based (ontology-based) logic clauses that could be directly used for automated compliance reasoning. Two alternative subschemas, following a closed-world assumption and an open-world assumption for noncompliance detection, respectively, were proposed and tested. The proposed IRep and CR schema was tested in representing and reasoning about quantitative regulatory requirements in Chapter 19 of the International Building Code 2009 and design information of a two-story duplex apartment test case in two ways, using perfect information and imperfect information. The closed-world assumption subschema was selected based on performance results; it achieved 100% recall and precision in noncompliance detection using perfect information and 98.7% recall and 87.6% precision in noncompliance detection using imperfect information.

While current CAD (Computer-Aided Design) systems provide a variety of data representation schemes (e.g. wire-frames, surface, and solid modeling) and data exchange protocols, they fail to address automation issues in retrieval of building information to be used in different AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) applications. The current research concentrates mainly on specific information about spatial relationships between building components to be designed at the preliminary stage. This paper describes a computerized building design framework developed using geometric solid modeling techniques, from which topological information of building components can be automatically generated and extracted to support various aspects in building design such as construction planning, constructability analysis, and building code compliance checking.

J	Xue, XR; Wu, J; Zhang, JS				Xue, Xiaorui; Wu, Jin; Zhang, Jiansong			Semiautomated Generation of Logic Rules for Tabular Information in Building Codes to Support Automated Code Compliance Checking	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							MODELING BIM; CONSTRUCTION	To fully automate building code compliance checking, regulatory requirements need to be automatically extracted and transformed from building codes. Existing regulatory requirement processing efforts mainly focus on building code requirements in text. A more efficient approach for processing regulatory requirements in other parts of building codes, such as tables or charts, remains to be addressed. The ability to process building code requirements in all parts and formats is necessary for an automated code compliance checking system to achieve full coverage of checkable building code requirements. To address this gap, the authors propose a semiautomated information extraction and transformation method. The proposed method can extract building code requirements in tables and convert extracted information to logic rules. Automated code compliance checking systems can utilize the logic rules. The proposed method includes two main steps: (1) tabular information extraction, and (2) rule generation. The tabular information extraction semiautomatically detects the layout of tables, extracts building code requirements from tables, and transforms extracted information to databases. The rule generation step automatically generates logic rules that can be directly executed by logic reasoners. The rule generation step also provides options for users to further refine the generated rules. The development of the tabular information extraction algorithm takes an iterative approach. An experiment was conducted to develop a tabular information extraction algorithm from a section of existing code. The primary version of the algorithm correctly processed 91.67% of tables in a second sample section. After iterative refinements, the updated tabular information extraction algorithm correctly processed all tables in this section. The rule generation algorithm correctly generated logic rules that successfully represented the applicable building code requirements for a testing building, a convenience store in Texas based on the tabular information.

J	Zhang, JS; El-Gohary, NM				Zhang, Jiansong; El-Gohary, Nora M.			Automated Information Transformation for Automated Regulatory Compliance Checking in Construction	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Automated compliance checking; Automated information extraction; Automated information transformation; Natural language processing; Semantic systems; Automated construction management systems	ONTOLOGY; EXTRACTION; FRAMEWORK; DESIGN	To fully automate regulatory compliance checking of construction projects, regulatory requirements need to be automatically extracted from various construction regulatory documents and then transformed into a formalized format that enables automated reasoning. To address this need, the authors propose an approach for automatically extracting information from construction regulatory textual documents and transforming them into logic clauses that could be directly used for automated reasoning. This paper focuses on presenting the proposed information transformation (ITr) methodology and the corresponding algorithms. The proposed ITr methodology utilizes a rule-based, semantic natural language processing (NLP) approach. A set of semantic mapping (SeM) rules and conflict resolution (CoR) rules are used to enable the automation of the transformation process. Several syntactic text features (captured using NLP techniques) and semantic text features (captured using an ontology) are used in the SeM and CoR rules. A bottom-up method is leveraged to handle complex sentence components. A consume and generate mechanism is proposed to implement the bottom-up method and execute the SeM rules. The proposed ITr algorithms were tested in transforming information instances of quantitative requirements, which were automatically extracted from the International Building Code 2009, into logic clauses. The algorithms achieved 98.2 and 99.1% precision and recall, respectively, on the testing data. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Ilal, SM; Gunaydin, HM				Ilal, Sibel Macit; Gunaydin, H. Murat			Computer representation of building codes for automated compliance checking	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building code representation; Automated compliance checking; Semantic modeling; BIM; IFC	FRAMEWORK; MODEL	Development of automated building code compliance checking systems requires appropriate representations for building codes. Building codes are complex documents written in natural languages, and the development of computable representations is challenging. This paper presents a new model and an accompanying modeling methodology for the representation of building codes that may be utilized in the development of future automated compliance checking systems. The new model combines the semantic modeling approach of the SMARTcodes project with the theoretical foundations established by Nyman arid Fenves, namely the four level representation. This hybrid model organizes the representation in four levels and allows for separate modeling of domain concepts, individual rule statements, relationships between rules, and the overall organization of the building code. The model is evaluated with a case study. The Izmir Municipality Housing and Zoning Code is chosen as it is representative of complex building codes that are in effect throughout Turkey. The formalizable rules in the section of Izmir code that apply to all types of buildings, are represented in computer implementable format based on the new model. The research presented in this paper shows that decomposing a building code into four levels and modeling rules based on the semantic-oriented paradigm is an effective modeling strategy for representing building codes in a computable form.

J	Xue, XR; Zhang, JS				Xue, Xiaorui; Zhang, Jiansong			Part-of-speech tagging of building codes empowered by deep learning and transformational rules	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Automated compliance checking; Automated information extraction; Natural language processing; Part-of-speech tagging; Automated construction management systems; Deep learning		Automated building code compliance checking systems were under development for many years. However, the excessive amount of human inputs needed to convert building codes from natural language to computer understandable formats severely limited their range of applicable code requirements. To address that, automated code compliance checking systems need to enable an automated regulatory rule conversion. Accurate Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging of building code texts is crucial to this conversion. Previous experiments showed that the state-of-the-art generic POS taggers do not perform well on building codes. In view of that, the authors are proposing a new POS tagger tailored to building codes. It utilizes deep learning neural network model and error-driven transformational rules. The neural network model contains a pre-trained model and one or more trainable neural layers. The pre-trained model was fine-tuned on Part-of-Speech Tagged Building Codes (PTBC), a POS tagged building codes dataset. The fine-tuning of pre-trained model allows the proposed POS tagger to reach high precision with a small amount of available training data. Error-driven transformational rules were used to boost performance further by fixing errors made by the neural network model in the tagged building code. Through experimental testing, the authors found a well-performing POS tagger for building codes that had one bidirectional LSTM trainable layer, utilized BERT_Cased_Base pre-trained model and was trained 50 epochs. This model reached a 91.89% precision without error-driven transformational rules and a 95.11% precision with error-driven transformational rules, which outperformed the 89.82% precision achieved by the state-of-the-art POS taggers.

This paper addresses this by ascertaining the blockers/obstacles to adoption and develops a road-map to overcome them. This work has been conducted in the UK and a road-map has been produced to drive forward adoption. More specifically this paper has; assessed the current state of the art in the field and engaged with industry to examine the attitudes to the digitisation of regulatory compliance processes. The results showed that industry believes that adoption of automation was both feasible and desirable, with the caveat that human oversight be maintained. Our road-map's methodical list of steps was judged to have the potential to bring the construction industry to the verge of mass industrialisation of automated compliance checking by 2025.

J	Xue, XR; Zhang, JS				Xue, Xiaorui; Zhang, Jiansong			Building Codes Part-of-Speech Tagging Performance Improvement by Error-Driven Transformational Rules	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Automated compliance checking; Automated information extraction; Natural language processing (NLP); Part-of-speech tagging; Automated construction management systems; Project management; Construction management; Information management; Computer applications; Artificial intelligence	COMPLIANCE CHECKING; SYSTEM; DESIGN	To enable full automation, automated code compliance checking systems need to extract regulatory information in building codes and convert it to computable representations. This conversion is a natural language processing (NLP) task that requires highly accurate part-of-speech (POS) tagging results on building codes. Existing POS taggers, however, do not provide such accuracy on building codes. To address this need, the authors propose to improve the performance of POS taggers by error-driven transformational rules that revise machine-tagged POS results. The proposed method utilizes a syntactic and semantic rule-based, NLP approach combined with a structure that is inspired by transfer learning. This method generates a group of transformational rulesets, from simple ones to complex ones, that will convert machine taggers' tagging results to their corresponding human-labeled gold standard. The transformational rules utilize syntactic and semantic information of domain texts. All rules are constrained not to introduce any new errors when fixing existing errors of machine taggers. The last ruleset, which fixes most common remaining errors in textual data after all other rules are applied, is exempted from this constraint. An experimental test on part-of-speech tagged building code (PTBC) data shows this method reduced 82.7% of errors in POS tagging results of building codes, which increased the POS tagging accuracy on building codes from 89.13% to 98.12%.

J	Khattra, SK; Singh, J; Rai, HS				Khattra, Satinder Kaur; Singh, Jagbir; Rai, Hardeep Singh			A Statistical Review to Study the Structural Stability of Buildings Using Building Information Modelling	ARCHIVES OF COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING			English	Review; Early Access							COMPLIANCE CHECKING; BIM; CONSERVATION; KNOWLEDGE; ADOPTION; IFC	Building Information Modelling is the revolution in the AEC industry. In the Architectural, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry, numerous interesting innovations are being introduced. The various technologies like Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality with BIM various researchers are doing their experiment to link these technologies. This paper reviews the Building Information Modelling for checking the building codes and it explicates the automatic building code compliance method. Design automation is the important process that catches the attention of many researchers and experts of the AEC industry and the initiation of code compliance in BIM is one of the essential factors for its accomplishment. This review also explains this Industry Foundation Classes and its importance of IFC in Building Information Modelling. In the BIM industry, Industry Foundation Classes is a major advancement it improves the collaboration among various BIM software, improves code testing system and it improves the data exchange methods. Reside in a structured surrounding built by some rules and regulations to safeguard life and safety. The builders ensure that the necessary design tests have been passed for all aspects of their proposed construction design. The design is approved after the modifications and mandatory revisions. The monotonous task is checking to build code rules, verifying the code compliance based on the country's building code design, and carrying out possible faults in design, and then making the required reconsiderations. The unwanted problems can be eliminated by the automated building code compliance system. This goal can be achieved by compiling the BIM model with a coding rule base engine that can save a particular country's design code with its clauses.

For healthcare projects in the UK, this includes statutory and guidance documents. Existing research indicates that they contain subjective requirements, which challenge the practical adoption of automated compliance checking, leading to limited outcomes. This paper aims to propose recommendations for the adoption of automated compliance checking in the design of healthcare buildings. Design Science Research was used to gain a detailed understanding of how information from existing regulatory requirements affects automation, through an empirical study in the design of a primary healthcare facility. In this study, a previously proposed taxonomy was implemented and refined, resulting in the identification of different types of subjective requirements. Based on empirical data emerging from the research, a set of recommendations was proposed focusing on the revision of regulatory documents, as well as to aid designers implementing automated compliance in practice.

J	Malsane, S; Matthews, J; Lockley, S; Love, PED; Greenwood, D				Malsane, Sagar; Matthews, Jane; Lockley, Steve; Love, Peter E. D.; Greenwood, David			Development of an object model for automated compliance checking	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						BIM standards; Interoperability; Knowledge formalisation; Object model; Compliance checking		Building designs in countries such as the United Kingdom are currently checked manually against a frequently changing and increasingly complex set of building regulations. This is a major task for designers and those bodies that are charged with enforcing the building regulations. As a result this can often lead to ambiguity, inconsistency in assessments and delays in the overall construction process. As the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry moves from 2D Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawings to more semantically rich Building Information Models (BIMs), the development of automated compliance checking systems for building regulations becomes achievable. A format well suited to the automation of compliance checking is that based upon Industry Foundation Class (IFC). IFC has been accepted worldwide as an inter-operability standard. However, whether the IFC data format can fully support the specialised needs of the England and Wales Building Regulations is still debatable. In order to automate their checking, building regulations first need to be interpreted from human-readable free text rules into a set of computer-implementable rules. This paper reviews previous research into automated code compliance-checking, identifies the key issues for future development, and focuses on the analysis of the England and Wales Building Regulations that relate to fire safety for dwelling houses, to determine and subsequently optimize the potential for automated compliance checking. Subsequently, a Building Regulation-specific, semantically rich object model, appropriate for the requirements of automated compliance checking has been developed for England and Wales.

Semantic NLP-Based Information Extraction from Construction Regulatory Documents for Automated Compliance Checking	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Project management; Construction management; Information management; Computer applications; Artificial intelligence; Documentation; Automated compliance checking; Automated information extraction; Semantic systems; Natural language processing; Automated construction management systems	ONTOLOGY; DESIGN	Automated regulatory compliance checking requires automated extraction of requirements from regulatory textual documents and their formalization in a computer-processable rule representation. Such information extraction (IE) is a challenging task that requires complex analysis and processing of text. Natural language processing (NLP) aims to enable computers to process natural language text in a human-like manner. This paper proposes a semantic, rule-based NLP approach for automated IE from construction regulatory documents. The proposed approach uses a set of pattern-matching-based IE rules and conflict resolution (CR) rules in IE. A variety of syntactic (syntax/grammar-related) and semantic (meaning/context-related) text features are used in the patterns of the IE and CR rules. Phrase structure grammar (PSG)-based phrasal tags and separation and sequencing of semantic information elements are proposed and used to reduce the number of needed patterns. An ontology is used to aid in the recognition of semantic text features (concepts and relations). The proposed IE algorithms were tested in extracting quantitative requirements from the 2009 International Building Code and achieved 0.969 and 0.944 precision and recall, respectively.

Automated Code Compliance Checking for Building Envelope Design	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Design code; Compliance checking; Building envelope	MODEL	Automating the checking of building envelope design according to design regulations is a complex process because these regulations consist of complicated logic sentences covering multiple functions. Existing mechanisms of building code computer-aided checking have some limitations dealing with design regulations. This paper presents a new integrated approach to automated code compliance checking for building envelope design based on simulation results and building codes. In this approach, building codes and simulation results are seamlessly linked with the compliance checking software. A hierarchical object-based representation of simulation results is proposed as an extended building information model (EBIM) to describe the attributes of a building and its subsystems. A representation of building codes based on decision tables and compatible with the EBIM is also proposed so that users can check the building envelope design against building codes based on the standardized simulation results. A prototype system is developed and a case study gives an example of evaluating the hygrothermal performance of an exterior wall.

A rule-based semantic approach for automated regulatory compliance in the construction sector	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Compliance checking; Regulations; Rule engine; Construction industry; Regulatory compliance; Semantics of regulations; Semantics of Regulatory Compliance	MANAGEMENT	A key concern for professionals in any industry is ensuring regulatory compliance. Regulations are often complex and require in depth technical knowledge of the domain in which they operate. The level of technical detail and complexity in regulations is a barrier to their automation due to extensive software development time and costs that are involved. In this paper we present a rule-based semantic approach formulated as a methodology to overcome these issues by allowing domain experts to specify their own regulatory compliance systems without the need for extensive software development. Our methodology is based on the key idea that three semantic contexts are needed to fully understand the regulations being automated: the semantics of the target domain, the specific semantics of regulations being considered, and the semantics of the data format that is to be checked for compliance. This approach allows domain experts to create and maintain their own regulatory compliance systems, within a semantic domain that is familiar to them. At the same time, our approach allows for the often diverse nature of semantics within a particular domain by decoupling the specific semantics of regulations from the semantics of the domain itself. This paper demonstrates how our methodology has been validated using a series of regulations automated by professionals within the construction domain. The regulations that have been developed are then in turn validated on real building data stored in an industry specific format (the IFCs). The adoption of this methodology has greatly advanced the process of automating these complex sets of construction regulations, allowing the full automation of the regulation scheme within 18 months. We believe that these positive results show that, by adopting our methodology, the barriers to the building of regulatory compliance systems will be greatly lowered and the adoption of three semantic domains proposed by our methodology provides tangible benefits.

Current inspection methods consist of inspectors physically searching for building defects with human vision while many defects ranging from structural cracks and loose nuts and bolts to inadequate sealant application and water damage go unnoticed due to varying factors such as limited line of sight and unavailability of safe access equipment. Human vision inspection procedures are also subject to additional deficiencies and complications during inspections of exterior defects as inspectors are often limited to inspect defects from the interior perimeter of the building, consequently compromising their safety and inspection quality. With an annual forecasted growth of 500,000 square feet of new construction each year, an enhanced commercial building inspection system for identifying exterior defects is in need. A stochastic simulation model was developed using distributions derived from time and motion studies to compare the time, safety, and accuracy of three design alternatives to collect, process, and analyze inspection data: (a) human vision inspection system, (b) manual use of automated defect identification system, and (c) aerial-based automated defect identification system. The design alternatives were ranked using a Multi-Attribute Utility Analysis as follows: (1) aerial-based automated defect identification system - 0.664, (2) manual use of automated defect identification system - 0.567, and (2) human vision inspection system - 0.443; the aerial-based automated defect identification system achieved a high utility score based on its improvements in inspection time, safety, and accuracy.

This allows architects and designers to calculate the thermal and energy performance of their designs. This paper identifies the strengths and weaknesses of these semi-automated simulation platforms. The objective is to investigate how accurate their assumptions are in determining a reliable output for use in achieving compliance with Clause H1 of the New Zealand Building Code. To achieve this, this paper reports a comparative study that examines the program's ability to calculate construction R-values, interpret thermal properties and simulate energy performance. The results from this study show that if used as delivered there is a significant difference between the simulation results of the two software packages, due to the assumptions built into the default settings. It also identifies the disadvantages of the inbuilt construction R-value calculators and explores a potential path to resolving this through redefining the inputs of thermal properties.	[Newmarch, E.

A fully automated code compliance checking would be desirable in facilitating a more efficient, cost effective, and human error-proof code checking. Such automation requires automated information extraction from building designs and building codes, and automated information transformation to a format that allows automated reasoning. Natural language processing (NLP) is an important technology to support such automated processing of building codes, because building codes are represented in natural language texts. Part-of-speech (POS) tagging, as an important basis of NLP tasks, must have a high performance to ensure the quality of the automated processing of building codes in such a compliance checking system. However, no systematic testing of existing POS taggers on domain specific building codes data have been performed. To address this gap, the authors analyzed the performance of seven state-of-the-at POS taggers on tagging building codes and compared their results to a manually-labeled gold standard. The authors aim to: (1) find the best performing tagger in terms of accuracy, and (2) identify common sources of errors. In providing the POS tags, the authors used the Penn Treebank tagset, which is a widely used tagset with a proper balance between conciseness and information richness. An average accuracy of 88.80% was found on the testing data. The Standford coreNLP tagger outperformed the other taggers in the experiment. Common sources of errors were identified to be: (1) word ambiguity, (2) rare words, and (3) unique meaning of common English words in the construction context. The found result of machine taggers on building codes calls for performance improvement, such as error-fixing transformational rules and machine taggers that are trained on building codes.

J	Guo, DM; Onstein, E; la Rosa, AD				Guo, Dongming; Onstein, Erling; la Rosa, Angela Daniela			A Semantic Approach for Automated Rule Compliance Checking in Construction Industry	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Automated compliance checking; data extraction; ifcOWL; natural language processing; SPARQL generation	BIM	Automated Compliance Checking (ACC) of building/construction projects is one of the important applications in Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry, because it provides the checking processes and results of whether a building design complies with relevant laws, policies and regulations. Currently, Automated Compliance Checking still involves lots of manual operations, and massive time and cost consumption. Additionally, some sub-tasks of ACC have been researched, while few studies can automatically implement the whole ACC process. To solve related issues, we proposed a semantic approach to implement the whole ACC process in an automated way. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used to extract rule terms and logic relationships among these terms from text regulatory documents. Rule terms are mapped to keywords (concepts or properties) in BIM data through term matching and semantic similarity analysis. After that, according to the mapped keywords in BIM and logic relationships among keywords, a corresponding SPARQL query is automatically generated. The query results can be non-compliance or compliance with rules based on the generated SPARQL query and requirements of stakeholders. The cases study proves that the proposed approach can provide a flexible and effective rule checking for BIM data. In addition, based on the proposed approach, we also further develop a semantic framework to implement automated rule compliance checking in construction industry.

Extending Building Information Models Semiautomatically Using Semantic Natural Language Processing Techniques	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Automated compliance checking (ACC); Automated information extraction; Building information modeling (BIM); Natural language processing; Semantic systems; Knowledge modeling; Industry foundation classes (IFC) extension; Automated construction management systems	SIMILARITY; PERCEPTRON	Automated compliance checking (ACC) of building designs requires automated extraction of information from building information models (BIMs). However, current industry foundation classes (IFC)-based BIMs provide limited support for ACC, because they lack the necessary information that is needed to perform compliance checking (CC). In this paper, the authors propose a new method for extending the IFC schema to incorporate CC-related information, in an objective and semiautomated manner. The method utilizes semantic natural language processing techniques and machine learning techniques to extract concepts from documents that are related to CC (e. g., building codes) and match the extracted concepts to concepts in the IFC class hierarchy. The proposed method includes a set of methods/algorithms that are combined into one computational platform: (1) a method for concept extraction that utilizes pattern-matching-based rules to extract regulatory concepts from CC-related regulatory documents; (2) a method for concept matching and semantic similarity assessment to select the most related IFC concepts to the extracted regulatory concepts; and (3) a machine learning classification method for predicting the relationship between the extracted regulatory concepts and their most related IFC concepts. The proposed method enables the extension of the IFC schema, in an objective way, using any construction regulatory document. To test and evaluate the proposed method, two chapters were randomly selected from the International Building Code (IBC) 2006 and 2009. Chapter 12 of IBC 2006 was used for training/development and Chapter 19 of IBC 2009 was used for testing and evaluation. Comparing to manually-developed gold standards, 91.7% F1-measure, 84.5% adoption rate, and 87.9% precision were achieved for regulatory concept extraction, IFC concept selection, and relationship classification, respectively.

J	Dimyadi, J; Clifton, C; Spearpoint, M; Amor, R				Dimyadi, Johannes; Clifton, Charles; Spearpoint, Michael; Amor, Robert			Computerizing Regulatory Knowledge for Building Engineering Design	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Regulatory knowledge model; Compliant design procedures; Building compliance model; Automated compliance audit; Building code	MODEL	Two common challenges in the computer-aided compliance audit of building engineering designs are addressed in the current research. The first is to ensure that any form of computable representation is practical and relatively easy to use and maintain. The second is to ensure that performance-based regulatory compliance criteria, which are often qualitative in nature, are adequately addressed and correctly represented. This research proposes a method of automating manual compliant design procedures using an open standard executable workflow representation that can be specified and maintained relatively easily by a design engineer. This executable workflow is referred to as the compliant design procedure (CDP) and can be described graphically. When executed in a computing environment, a CDP can guide the compliance audit process by checking a given design represented in a model view or subset of the building information model (BIM), referred to as the building compliance model (BCM), against the criteria in a digital building code, referred to as the regulatory knowledge model (RKM), which is developed specifically for this purpose. This paper describes the process of modeling and encoding BCM, CDP, and RKM, which are independent input components of the proposed compliance audit system framework. Supplementary human input and the ability to exchange input and output data with external simulation tools to solve some of the more complex qualitative criteria are important features of the framework.

As a result, manual estimation results are influenced by each estimator's judgement or opinion. The use of computing technology can help automate this cost estimation process, reducing the subjectivity in estimation, improving the efficiency and the accuracy of cost estimation. This has been shown by the success of various building information modeling (BIM) software products. Nevertheless, existing cost estimation automation methods in these tools are still limited in terms of: (1) interoperability - in spite of their compliance with the industry foundation classes (IFC) schema, the detailed implementation in complying with IFC is largely proprietary; and (2) full automation - manual input is needed in various ways to fulfill the information need of the cost estimation automation. To address these two limitations, in this study, the authors developed a method and algorithms for fully automated cost estimation in wood construction, leveraging the fundamental geometric representation of wood building object representations in IFC models for quantity takeoff, and a price computation using a cost database generated from RSMeans Assemblies Cost Data 2015. The developed automated cost estimation method and algorithms were implemented in java programs and tested in a case study wood building project in Kalamazoo, MI area. By comparing with estimates from existing BIM tools, improvement in interoperability and a reduction in manual input were observed using the authors' newly developed method and algorithms.

Automated Compliance Checking of Construction Operation Plans Using a Deontology for the Construction Domain	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Project management; Construction management; Information management; Automation; Artificial intelligence; Deontology; Automated compliance checking; Semantic systems; Automated construction management systems	CODE CHECKING; FRAMEWORK; KNOWLEDGE; ONTOLOGY; DESIGN; LOGIC	Automated compliance checking (ACC) in the construction domain continues to be a challenge. Current ACC systems do not provide the level of knowledge representation and reasoning that is needed to efficiently interpret applicable norms (e.g.,laws, regulations, contractual requirements, advisory practices) and check conformance of designs and operations to those interpretations. In this paper, the authors explore a new approach to ACC and propose to apply theoretical and computational developments in the fields of deontology, deontic logic, and natural language processing to the problem of compliance checking in construction. Deontology is a theory of rights and obligations, and deontic logic is a branch of modal logic that deals with obligations, prohibitions, and permissions. This paper focuses on presenting a deontology for ACC in construction. The deontic model is composed of a hierarchy of normative concepts, interconcept relations, and deontic axioms (rules represented using deontic logic). The deontology was evaluated through formal competency questions, automated consistency checking, automated redundancy checking, expert evaluation, and application-oriented evaluation. The deontic model was manually applied in checking the compliance of storm-water pollution prevention plans with applicable norms. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Kincelova, K; Boton, C; Blanchet, P; Dagenais, C				Kincelova, Kristina; Boton, Conrad; Blanchet, Pierre; Dagenais, Christian			Fire Safety in Tall Timber Building: A BIM-Based Automated Code-Checking Approach	BUILDINGS			English	Article						BIM; fire safety; compliance checking; building code; visual programming	MODEL	Fire safety regulations impose very strict requirements on building design, especially for buildings built with combustible materials. It is believed that it is possible to improve the management of these regulations with a better integration of fire protection aspects in the building information modeling (BIM) approach. A new BIM-based domain is emerging, the automated code checking, with its growing number of dedicated approaches. However, only very few of these works have been dedicated to managing the compliance to fire safety regulations in timber buildings. In this paper, the applicability to fire safety in the Canadian context is studied by constituting and executing a complete method from the regulations text through code-checking construction to result analysis. A design science approach is used to propose a code-checking method with a detailed analysis of the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) in order to obtain the required information. The method starts by retrieving information from the regulation text, leading to a compliance check of an architectural building model. Then, the method is tested on a set of fire safety regulations and validated on a building model from a real project. The selected fire safety rules set a solid basis for further development of checking rules for the field of fire safety. This study shows that the main challenges for rule checking are the modeling standards and the elements' required levels of detail. The implementation of the method was successful for geometrical as well as non-geometrical requirements, although further work is needed for more advanced geometrical studies, such as sprinkler or fire dampers positioning.

J	Bloch, T; Sacks, R				Bloch, Tanya; Sacks, Rafael			Clustering Information Types for Semantic Enrichment of Building Information Models to Support Automated Code Compliance Checking	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Automated code compliance checking; Building information modeling (BIM); Clustering; Semantic enrichment; Unsupervised learning		Missing, incomplete, implicit, and/or incorrect information are major obstacles to automated code compliance checking in the construction industry. All existing platforms for automated code checking require users to extensively preprocess their input models to supplement missing information before checking can begin. Semantic enrichment using artificial intelligence (AI) can automate much of this normalization process. Progress in the field of semantic enrichment, in turn, requires identification and specification of the information types that must be made explicit, and of the procedures appropriate for each type. After characterizing a broad set of clauses from five diverse building codes, a two-stage clustering process with the k-means algorithm was used to derive a hierarchical classification of semantic enrichment task types. The resulting classification defines 10 tasks that are typically needed for automated code compliance checking. Future research can build on the classification to formalize a knowledge base to inform selection of appropriate approaches for semantic enrichment tasks.

C	Nawari, NO; Alsaffar, A		Volz, JS		Nawari, Nawari O.; Alsaffar, Adel			The Role of BIM in Simplifying Construction Permits in Kuwait	AEI 2017: RESILIENCE OF THE INTEGRATED BUILDING			English	Proceedings Paper	Architectural Engineering National Conference (AEI)	APR 11-13, 2017	Oklahoma City, OK	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Architectural Engn Inst, Amer Soc Civil Engineers			LANGUAGE; CODES	The construction industry in Kuwait is steadily growing, specifically in the housing market. This displays great challenges for authority to check and verify construction documents and provide permits within a reasonable timeframe. This situation is even getting more critical as building codes and regulations are becoming increasingly complex and variable as they introduce new design criterion and recent advancements in building construction. The need for computerizing the permitting procedure and automating the code compliance auditing process is becoming ever more important. Building information modeling (BIM) has the potential in simplifying the construction permitting process if it can be implemented across trades in Kuwait. Within the context of BIM workflow, automated BIM model checking process against building codes and standards frameworks employs rule-based systems to a proposed design, with results such as "success", "failure" or "warning", or 'unknown' for cases where the needed data is incomplete or missing. This automation method will streamline the permitting process and provide ways to enhance the overall efficiency of the construction industry in Kuwait. This research work seeks to examine the role of BIM in improving the permitting procedure in Kuwait and tackle the defragmentation of the construction industry. The investigation also provides an overview of existing frameworks for automated code verification in building design and particularly architectural and structural design. The paper proposes a new framework for simplifying the permitting procedure for the residential housing in Kuwait.

J	Karimidorabati, S; Haas, CT; Gray, J				Karimidorabati, Shahin; Haas, Carl T.; Gray, Joel			Evaluation of automation levels for construction change management	ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Workflow; Change management; Construction; Automated processes; Change documents; Discrete-event simulation	AGENT-BASED SIMULATION; CHANGE ORDERS; PROJECT CHANGE; MODEL; IMPACT; DESIGN; SYSTEM; PERFORMANCE; FRAMEWORK; REWORK	Purpose - Current processes to manage changes are subject to failure since they are heavily dependent on human discipline. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate and quantify the difference between levels of automation of change management processes and to provide input for determining the use of automation systems for change management. Design/methodology/approach - Three generations of change management processes are defined to represent progressive practices used in major capital projects over the past few decades. Discrete event simulation was used to model these processes to capture their behavior and compare their performance according to time and compliance metrics. An oil and gas megaproject served to validate the findings of this modeling and analysis. Findings - The results showed that automated processes can bring more compliance and real-time traceability, but not a significant time reduction in the change process. This contributes to the understanding of the impact of workflow-based automation on construction process performance. The validity of the conclusions are limited by the breadth of sectors studied and the inability to capture off-line time allocations of the personnel involved. Future research may build on the work presented here by studying additional processes such as requests for information, project change notices, requests for scaffolding, and interface management in various industry sectors. Originality/value - A new approach for modeling and evaluating construction management process automation is contributed and the specific results of the paper indicate that automated workflow-based change management processes should be implemented in megaprojects.

J	Aydin, M				Aydin, Murat			Building Information Modeling Based Automated Building Regulation Compliance Checking Asp.net Web Software	INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION AND SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Asp.net web software; automated code compliance checking; building information modeling; MVC architectural pattern; C# programming language	CODE; IMPLEMENTATION; DESIGN	Building regulations used in the architecture, engineering, and construction sectors are legal documents prepared under the control of local authorities for use by individuals. These regulations determine the conditions for ensuring performance and quality throughout the entire construction process. The building regulation inspection process conducted with the traditional manual method is time-consuming and error-prone for architects, engineers, and local authorities. It is known that most of these inspections are carried out with municipalities by local authorities. The mutual interview study and literature review shows that there is no standard rule for the legal auditing process and the same services are defined differently by different municipalities. The aim of the study is to create building information modeling based automated building regulation compliance checking software (BIMTRAC3) for municipality users, thereby providing an automated code compliance checking (ACCC) process for housing projects according to the Planned Areas Zoning Regulation in Turkey. It includes a rule-based ACCC method which allows for simultaneous computerized code checking that considers the characteristics of the building elements and the relevant building regulations. It is able to perform the ACCC process and send the ACCC result report of the sample housing project by BIMTRAC3. It provides various solutions for problems experienced by municipalities during the ACCC process.

There are lots of criteria such as fire safety, structure, sustainability etc. which must be controlled by the designers. To improve the performance and accessibility of buildings, governing bodies publish different codes for each of the different criteria. Buildings must comply with these codes to get a permit for construction. The checking of the buildings according the codes is done manually by code officials. This process is time consuming, high in cost and prone to errors. To remedy this problem by using the tools like BIM and AI, systems that can automatically check the code compliance of projects are being developed. In this paper we provide an overview of the structures and capabilities of these systems and present the automated code compliance checking system that we develop for checking building models against some parts of the Turkish Fire Codes.

Literature has provided evidence of extensive research effort, with varying degrees of success, alongside the evolution of computing and supporting technologies. New innovations in theoretical and applied computing, coupled with a strong industry demand, has opened up opportunities that promise to bring this quest closer to reality. This paper reviews evolving approaches for automated compliance checking, addressing challenges in sharing digital architectural and engineering design information, formalising normative provisions as computable rules, and methods of processing them for compliance. The paper identifies current state-of-the-art implementations, discusses challenges faced in national efforts, and highlights future pathways.

J	Li, FL; Song, YB; Shan, YW				Li, Fulin; Song, Yuanbin; Shan, Yongwei			Joint Extraction of Multiple Relations and Entities from Building Code Clauses	APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL			English	Article						regulation information extraction; building code; deep learning; automated code compliance checking		The extraction of regulatory information is a prerequisite for automated code compliance checking. Although a number of machine learning models have been explored for extracting computer-understandable engineering constraints from code clauses written in natural language, most are inadequate to address the complexity of the semantic relations between named entities. In particular, the existence of two or more overlapping relations involving the same entity greatly exacerbates the difficulty of information extraction. In this paper, a joint extraction model is proposed to extract the relations among entities in the form of triplets. In the proposed model, a hybrid deep learning algorithm combined with a decomposition strategy is applied. First, all candidate subject entities are identified, and then, the associated object entities and predicate relations are simultaneously detected. In this way, multiple relations, especially overlapping relations, can be extracted. Furthermore, nonrelated pairs are excluded through the judicious recognition of subject entities. Moreover, a collection of domain-specific entity and relation types is investigated for model implementation. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model is promising for extracting multiple relations and entities from building codes.

A Review on BIM-Based Automated Code Compliance Checking System	2017 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RESEARCH AND INNOVATION IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS (ICRIIS 2017): SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION THROUGH DATA SCIENCE	International Conference on Research and Innovation in Information Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Research and Innovation in Information Systems (ICRIIS) - Social Transformation through Data Science	JUL 16-17, 2017	Langkawi, MALAYSIA			Building Information Modeling (BIM); Industry Foundation Classes (IFC); automated code compliance checking system; rule interpretation		The checking process of the building design with building regulations or codes is a time-consuming and error prone process. The automation of code compliance checking process has been explored since 1960s and becoming more vigorous with the emergence of Building Information Modeling (BIM). A neutral format, Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) which is developed under BIM platform had led to better collaboration and information exchange throughout BIM software and development of the checking system. Generally, the structure of an automated system consists of rule interpretation stage, building model preparation stage, rule execution stage and rule reporting stage. Rule interpretation stage is the most vital and complex stage. In interpreting the rules, various techniques have been investigated and applied to employ comprehensive and accurate checking process on the building designs which are mainly in IFC format. The most common techniques used are by utilizing existing software such as Solibri Model Checker, establishing a plug-in application, adopting object-based approach, logical approach and ontological approach. This paper provides a highlight and review on previous studies which successfully employed the appropriate techniques in interpreting the rules for checking purposes. This will subsequently assist future research on this area and create more astounding code compliance checking system.

There are also many BIM-related research initiatives worldwide. Likewise, the Korean government has joined this trend by improving its existing e-Submission system, SEUMTER, to provide for BIM-based e-submission and automated code compliance checking. Further, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport in Korea has funded the Korea BIM (KBIM) building e-Submission system project. The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data model is an openBlM approach that has been designated as an international standard through the International Organization for Standardization. It is not dependent on specific design tools and is suitable for public works applications. Hence, this study performed a comprehensive analysis of and developed a framework for a prototypical system for an e-Submission process based on the IFC data model. Four main modules were developed to perform code checking, submission, pre-checking, and automated rule-making. A real-world project was used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework. This study could increase the adoption of BIM-based building e-Submission systems by sharing effective and successful processes.

Most previous studies have focused on the processing of design codes for conformance checking. In this work, the writers examine additional issues: the criteria of a building model, the representation of code provisions, the relevance of the provisions with respect to design components, and the encoding of component-based provisions. In this paper, the writers will demonstrate the integration of these issues in the framework in order to develop an effective system to analyze a design for code compliance.

The use of computational algorithms has traditionally been used by architecture firms but is starting to also grow in popularity throughout mainstream construction for automation of design tasks, as-built analysis, and for creation of parametric models. This paper demonstrates how computational algorithms can be used to support digital twins in construction and how these workflows can be used to converge on optimal and heuristic solutions to challenging problems. Two examples are explored in this paper. The first is a computational algorithm addressed at a complex geometric challenge in the processing of architectural cladding panels for manufacturing. The second example is a computational workflow comprised of algorithms that extract and process metadata in BIM for automated egress path compliance checking. Lessons learned from these examples demonstrate the power of computational algorithms for complex and highly repetitive design processes. Computational algorithms are proven herein to explore large decision space domains efficiently, and pre-emptively catch costly design/analysis errors.

Semantic Text Classification for Supporting Automated Compliance Checking in Construction	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Automated compliance checking; Semantic systems; Automated construction management systems; Natural language processing; Text classification; Machine learning	RECALL	Automated regulatory and contractual compliance checking requires automated rule extraction from regulatory and contractual textual documents (e.g., contract specifications). Automated rule extraction is a challenging task that requires complex processing of text. In the proposed automated compliance checking (ACC) approach, the first step in automating the rule extraction process is automatically classifying the different documents and parts of documents (e.g., contract clauses) into predefined categories (environmental, safety, health, etc.) for preparing it for further text analysis and rule extraction. These categories are defined in a semantic model for normative reasoning. This paper presents a semantic, machine learning-based text classification algorithm for classifying clauses and subclauses of general conditions for supporting ACC in construction. The multilabel classification problem was transformed into a set of binary classification problems. Different machine learning algorithms, text preprocessing techniques, methods of text feature scoring, methods of feature weighting, and feature sizes were implemented and evaluated at different thresholds. The developed classifier achieved 100 and 96% recall and precision, respectively, on the testing data. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The current rule-based compliance checking practice is a costly bottleneck in a building project, and thus, there is a demand for a design evaluation process that incorporates automated checking capabilities to address the inefficiency and the error-prone nature of the current manual checking practice. The inherent complexity of building design rules and impracticability of existing automated checking approaches are two key challenges that must be addressed to enable practical compliance checking automation. This research study proposes a new modularized framework that integrates the emerging open standard, LegalRuleML, with a Visual Programming Language. The framework allows a standardized method of defining design rules in a machine-readable and executable format. The proposed approach encompasses the entire compliance checking process from the interpretation of natural language -based requirements to machine-readable rules, rule categorization, rule parameterization, and the execution of the rules on the ISO-standard building information model. This modularized BIM-based design validation framework is expected to help automatically and iteratively evaluate the level of quality and defects of information conveyed in a given building model as an essential part of the early design process.

A Clustering Approach for Analyzing the Computability of Building Code Requirements	CONSTRUCTION RESEARCH CONGRESS 2018: CONSTRUCTION INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Proceedings Paper	Construction Research Congress	APR 02-04, 2018	Louisiana State Univ, Bert S Turner Dept Construct Management, New Orleans, LA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Construct Inst, Construct Res Council, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Construct Inst	Louisiana State Univ, Bert S Turner Dept Construct Management			Automated code compliance checking has been implemented using a variety of different methods. These methods vary widely in terms of automation level, expressivity, representativeness, accuracy, and efficiency. Although most of the existing methods/tools are similar in that they represent the code requirements in the form of rules, the semantic representation and language/format they use for rule representation vary from a method/tool to another. One common limitation of all these methods/tools is the inability to fully represent all types of requirements (e.g., requirements that are too complex or that require human judgment by nature). More research is, thus, needed to better identify what the different types of requirements are-in terms of their semantics and syntactics-and which of them could be represented in a computer-processable form. To address this need, this paper proposes a new methodology for identifying the different types of building code requirements in terms of computability. The proposed methodology consists of three primary tasks: (1) use a machine-learning clustering algorithm to identify the computational clusters of the code requirements, (2) identify the different types of requirements in the different clusters, in terms of their semantic and syntactic features and structures, complexity, etc., and (3) determine the computability of different sentence types. The proposed methodology was implemented and tested on a corpus of sentences from the 2015 International Building Code. The paper discusses the clustering and analysis methodology and results.

J	Altintas, YD; Ilal, ME				Altintas, Yelin Demir; Ilal, Mustafa Emre			Loose coupling of GIS and BIM data models for automated compliance checking against zoning codes	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Automated compliance checking; BIM; Data coupling; GIS; Interoperability	INTEGRATION; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM	Modeling urban data is crucial for supporting automated code checking processes. Ideally, digitally modelled building codes and urban data should be retrieved from municipalities, and the digital building model should be checked automatically based on the collected information. However, BIM tools do not contain and do not allow managing geographical information at a neighborhood scale. Current GIS applications also do not store all of the information required by building codes. Even if they did, interoperability between GIS and BIM environments are problematic. This paper describes the development of a zoning domain model for automated compliance checking of building projects. The proposed model is illustrated through a proof-of-concept GIS application, where geometric and semantic data are stored, queried and exported as a GML file. Use of this data model for automated code checking is an example for how GIS data can seamlessly complement BIM data making expansion of BIM schemas unnecessary.

These criteria contain both building codes and customer requirements. The paper extends the logic-based reasoning methods used previously in computer-aided visual design to a fuzzy classification. The fuzzy classification of the drawings representing early design solutions is based on approximate reasoning, where different types of criteria are considered. Due to this classification the system is able to evaluate the correspondence of potential solutions to the project specification and check their code compliance. The approach is illustrated by example of designing layouts of a small office.

BIM-based compliance audit requirements for building consent processing	EWORK AND EBUSINESS IN ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION			English	Proceedings Paper	12th European Conference on Product and Process Modelling (ECPPM)	SEP 12-14, 2018	Copenhagen, DENMARK					The progressive uptake of ISO-standard BIM (Building Information Modelling) in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facilities Management (AEC/ FM) industry in recent years has started to make common building information accessible to all project stakeholders and processes. Building Consent Authorities (BCA) are exploring how to take advantage of the benefits provided by BIM for automating some of the laborious and repetitive compliance auditing tasks that are part of the core consenting process. This paper describes a proof-of-concept project undertaken in conjunction with a BCA in New Zealand to identify requirements for implementing and to assess the industry's readiness for the BIM-based consenting process. An automated compliance audit tool, ACABIM, was used in the project. The findings of the project suggests that there is a clear indication of productivity, efficiency and analytical benefits gain. The main outcome of the project is a document specifying the minimum data requirements for BIM-based consent submission.

The rapid growth of these virtually provisioned cloud networks has increased the demand for automated reasoning tools capable of identifying misconfigurations or security vulnerabilities. This type of automation gives customers the assurance they need to deploy sensitive workloads. It can also reduce the cost and time-to-market for regulated customers looking to establish compliance certification for cloud-based applications. In this industrial case-study, we describe a new network reachability reasoning tool, called Twos, that uses off-the-shelf automated theorem proving tools to fill this need. Twos is the foundation of a recently introduced network security analysis feature in the Amazon Inspector service now available to millions of customers building applications in the cloud. Twos is also used within Amazon Web Services (AWS) to automate the checking of compliance certification and adherence to security invariants for many AWS services that build on existing AWS networking features.

Considering the huge number of models each company possesses, automation of compliance maintenance becomes essential. Therefore, many approaches focused on automation of various aspects of compliance problem, e.g., compliance verification. Such techniques allow localizing the problem within the process model. However, they are not able to resolve the violations. In this paper we address the problem of (semi) automatic violation resolution, addressing violations of execution ordering compliance rules. We build upon previous work in categorizing the violations into types and employ automated planning to ensure compliance. The problem of choosing the concrete resolution strategy is addressed by the concept of context.

J	Zhou, P; El-Gohary, N				Zhou, Peng; El-Gohary, Nora			Ontology-based automated information extraction from building energy conservation codes	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Information extraction; Ontology; Natural language processing; Automated compliance checking; Energy conservation codes	CHECKING; DESIGN; SYSTEM	An ontology-based information extraction algorithm for automatically extracting energy requirements from energy conservation codes is proposed. The proposed algorithm aims to support fully-automated energy compliance checking in the construction domain by allowing automated extraction of the requirements from the codes instead of the status quo which relies on manual extraction of requirements from codes and manual formalization of those requirements in a computer-processable format. Automated information extraction from energy conservation codes, compared to other building codes, is a far complex task because many code provisions are long, hierarchically-complex, and with exceptions. A combination of text classification methods, domain-specific preprocessing techniques, ontology-based pattern-matching extraction techniques, sequential dependency based extraction methods, and cascaded extraction methods is proposed to deal with such complexity in extraction. The proposed algorithm was tested in extracting energy requirements from Chapter 4 of the 2012 International Energy Conservation Code, and the results showed 97.4% recall and 98.5% precision.

J	Sydora, C; Stroulia, E				Sydora, Christoph; Stroulia, Eleni			Rule-based compliance checking and generative design for building interiors using BIM	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building information modeling; Rule language; Compliance checking; Generative interior design	LANGUAGE	Building Information Modeling (BIM) is becoming an integral part of the design, architecture, and construction process, as it can integrate all building data in an accessible digital representation that can be viewed in a 3D environment prior to construction. This supports the capability of evaluating a model against building codes or design rules to ensure that the building meets the relevant functional and safety requirements for occupants. However, building regulations are typically represented in natural language and, to date, they have not been created with regard to the digital BIM design process. To automate the design evaluation of a building model, this paper describes a simple, yet extendable, domain-specific language for computationally representing building interior design rules and a method for evaluating rules in this language against a BIM model. Furthermore, previous language-based model-checking approaches have not explored the applicability of their proposed languages beyond model-design evaluation. This paper demonstrates the use of our language in a second, more complex, use case, namely the automated generation of multiple valid alternative model interior designs, compliant to a set of design rules expressed in our language. We have evaluated the usefulness of our language in two generative-design case studies, namely kitchen layouts using a set of real-world kitchen design rules provided by an commercial partner, and living-room layouts using rules put forward in earlier automated-design research. Therefore, this research bridges the concepts of automated model checking and generative design relying on the same rule language.

Facilitating compliance with BIM ISO 19650 naming convention through automation	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						Computer-aided manufacturing and design; Building information modelling (BIM); AutoBIM; IT in construction; ISO 19650; Revit plug-in	CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; DIGITAL CONSTRUCTION; WASTE; FRAMEWORK	Purpose To foster effective implementation of building information modelling (BIM), it is guided by standards and protocols that require files naming in a format, containing a string of letters and digits in a tightly defined manner, which is perceived to be time-consuming, error-prone and serves as a barrier to BIM adoption. This paper aims to present a BIM-based plug-in solution (Auto-BIMName) that facilitates automated naming in compliance with BIM standards. Design/methodology/approach The Auto-BIMName portal has an information management system (IMS) for generating a master information delivery plan (MIDP), which serves as pre-requisites to effective file naming. Once the naming schema is implemented through text input controls for a project name, volume, level and number, the Revit plugin communicates with its IMS to fetch the name string or concatenate the string in line with the ISO 19650 convention, where the IMS is unused. The system was validated through a simulated collaborative project. Findings System testing and evaluation confirmed that the Auto-BIMName will ease the process of file naming, thereby facilitating collaboration efficiency, naming consistency across project teams and lifecycle stages, ease of file naming, time-saving and inducement for BIM implementation, etc. By linking information from MIDP in the BIM execution plan, the platform enhanced information management processes and improved coordination across project teams and lifecycle stages. Originality/value Apart from demonstrating how the automated naming platform enhances project performance, information management and coordination, the paper provides a practical demonstration of how the construction industry will benefit from enhanced digitalisation and process automation.

An automated standard-based life cycle quality inspection methodology for smart precast concrete solutions in buildings	JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY AND MAINTENANCE			English	Article						Quality checks; smart construction; precast concrete; embedded sensors; methodology; quality assurance	FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY; SENSOR; INSTALLATION; PERFORMANCE; TRACKING; MODELS	Built2Spec research project brought together a new and breakthrough set of tools in order to improve construction quality inspection processes. These can be put into the hands of construction stakeholders to help meet Europe's energy efficiency targets, standards for constructing and retrofitting buildings, and related policy ambitions. This paper focuses on the automated standard-based life cycle quality inspections for precast concrete structural building elements that can be enhanced by leveraging a range of different technologies. Particular attention is placed on the use of embedded sensors in the precast concrete structural building elements as a tool to support quality assurance of these elements. Starting with the design, through manufacturing, delivery to site, installation, commissioning and operation until the end of life, the performance of precast concrete building elements is monitored and controlled to ensure their compliance with specifications, standards and guidelines. The outputs of proposed technologies integrated within the virtual construction management platform (VCMP) can enable automated continuous quality checks, while making them accessible to stakeholders through the life of a building. The measurements to support the development of this methodology were provided by a newly constructed demonstration building in Ireland.

J	Zhang, RC; El-Gohary, N				Zhang, Ruichuan; El-Gohary, Nora			Clustering-Based Approach for Building Code Computability Analysis	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Buildings; Code checking; Computability; Text analytics; Hierarchical clustering	MODEL; FRAMEWORK; CHECKING; DESIGN; SYSTEM	One common limitation of all automated code compliance-checking methods and tools is their inability to deal with all types of building-code requirements. More research is needed to better identify the different types of requirements, in terms of their syntactic and semantic structures and complexities, to gain more insights about the capabilities and limitations of existing methods and tools (i.e., which requirements they can automatically process, represent, or check, and which not). To address this need, this paper proposes a new set of syntactic and semantic features and complexity and computability metrics for code computability analysis. A clustering-based approach was used to identify the different types of code sentences, in terms of their computability, using the proposed features and metrics. The approach was implemented and tested on a corpus of 6,608 sentences from the International Building Code and its amendments. The sentence clusters and identified sentence types were evaluated using intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methods. The evaluation results indicated good clustering performance, perfect alignment between the human- and computer-identified types, and good agreement in the assignment of sentences to the types.

J	Seghier, TE; Ahmad, MH; Lim, YW				Seghier, Taki Eddine; Ahmad, Mohd Hamdan; Lim, Yaik-Wah			Automation of Concrete Usage Index (CUI) assessment using computational BIM	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						Computational BIM; Dynamo; Visual programing language; Green building certification; Sustainability analysis; Automated compliance-checking		Concrete Usage Index (CUI) is one of the very used sustainability criteria related to building materials available in the Malaysian and the Singaporean building standards. Often, CUI assessment is achieved either by manual calculation or semi-automated methods based on Material Take-off functionalities provided by the BIM tools. Both of these methods are relatively time-consuming, error-prone, and require much human intervention. The purpose of this paper is to develop a computational BIM-based tool for the automation of Concrete Usage Index (CUI)assessment and rating, called Auto-CUI. This tool takes advantage of the data embedded in the BIM model and the automated CUI compliance-checking which is developed using a Visual Programing Language (Dynamo for Revit). For validation purpose, this tool has been tested on a BIM model of an existing building and the results were compared with Revit Material Take-off method. Thus, Auto-CUI tool automates the process of data collection, calculation and the generation of the CUI report. In addition to that, the generated results are as accurate as the material take-off method. Auto-CUI will support design decision-making during the design stage by providing an interactive feedback of CUI actual score and rating. Thus, the project team will be able to compare different design options according to the concrete usage. Furthermore, it will allow designers to avoid CUI's cumbersome calculations and inaccurate outputs. Even though, the usage of this tool does not require programming skills, developing this tool further as a plug-in for Revit would be helpful in reducing computation time as well as enhancing the generation of CUI report.

Semantic BIM reasoner for the verification of IFC Models	EWORK AND EBUSINESS IN ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION			English	Proceedings Paper	12th European Conference on Product and Process Modelling (ECPPM)	SEP 12-14, 2018	Copenhagen, DENMARK				FRAMEWORK	Recent years have witnessed the development of various techniques and tools for the building code-compliance of IFC models. Indeed these are great efforts, but, still there is a gap for the fully automatic building code-compliance. This paper presents our research and development of Semantic BIM Reasoner (SBIM-Reasoner) which employs semantic technologies to meet the requirements of semantic verification of an IFC model. SBIM-Reasoner employs several preprocessors (IFC to RDF converter, Geometry Extractor) to build the semantic repository from the input IFC model. Once all the triples are generated from the initial data (.ifc file), Stardog is used to build a knowledge graph for the semantic verification. All types of inference and reasoning mechanisms for the semantic verification are applied over this knowledge graph to meet the requirements of verification. Knowledge graph over triplets enables freedom of extending RDF based Semantic IFC model, creation of newer vocabulary and formation of newer rules, concatenation of triplets to build rules with condition and constraints over IFC data, dynamic reasoning over the triplets based on the initial data of IFC model, etc. Finally, we tested our prototype by using several online IFC models. We conclude that semantic technologies provide more rich mechanisms and answer vast types of queries for the verification of IFC models. It provides powerful features based on SPARQL libraries and serves best for the automated code compliance and verification of IFC models.

J	Bosche, F				Bosche, Frederic			Automated recognition of 3D CAD model objects in laser scans and calculation of as-built dimensions for dimensional compliance control in construction	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article							REGISTRATION; INSPECTION	The construction industry lacks solutions for accurately, comprehensively and efficiently tracking the three-dimensional (3D) status of buildings under construction. Such information is however critical to the successful management of construction projects: It supports fundamental activities such as progress tracking and construction dimensional quality control. In this paper, a new approach for automated recognition of project 3D Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model objects in large laser scans is presented, with significant improvements compared to the one originally proposed in Bosche et al. (in press) [11]. A more robust point matching method is used and registration quality is improved with the implementation of an Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based fine registration step. Once the optimal registration of the project's CAD model with a site scan is obtained, a similar ICP-based registration algorithm is proposed to calculate the as-built poses of the CAD model objects. These as-built poses are then used for automatically controlling the compliance of the project with respect to corresponding dimensional tolerances. Experimental results are presented with data obtained from the erection of an industrial building's steel structure. They demonstrate the performance in real field conditions of the model registration and object recognition algorithms, and show the potential of the proposed approach for as-built dimension calculation and control.

Building design and construction process are conditioned by numerous sustainability regulations and assessment measures. With the increasing use of building simulations, the potential of improving design features and promoting efficient construction has become a routine practice, starting at early stages of design and carried out throughout the life cycle of a building. Nevertheless, the construction process is currently lacking the presence of integrated systems that allow dynamic compliance checking of design features with building regulations using instant results from building simulation tools. Such integrated system requires access to regulatory compliance data and appropriate information exchange mechanism between building information model, regulatory requirements and building simulations tools. This paper will present an initiative for developing an integrated system that facilitates managing building performance dynamically through an appropriate information management process combining sustainability regulatory and building simulations with building information modeling. The paper will present a valid implementation results of compliance checking against some criteria of BREEAM assessment process. The quantitative analysis of the results revealed that more than 50% of compliance requirements cannot be fully automated and still requires users input. This is due to the fact that the IFC data model used for data extraction lacks a representation of certain domains of data.

Freedom through constraints: User-oriented architectural design	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Natural Language Processing; Design constraints; Automated interpretation	NATURAL-LANGUAGE	In this article we report on validated research for the construction of design constraints by automated interpretation of natural language input. We show how our approach of dynamic reconfigurations of parsed syntax trees using a number of production rules is used to formalize and transform natural language constructs into computable constraints that are applied to concrete building information models. The calibration and validation of the proposed algorithms and production rules is based on two test data sets: The verbatim text of Dutch building code regulations for dormer extensions on existing roofs and constraints formulated ad hoc by design students based upon a series of example designs. We show how a prototypical implementation of our approach can be used to interpret 44% of the test data without human interference and how the remaining sentences can be interpreted with minimal additional effort or further development.

Automating the checking process can avoid potential calculation mistakes and allow designers to optimize building envelope design more efficiently. To this end, machine-readable code translation with high level of accuracy and correctness is a strong need. This paper thus presents a visual programming language (VPL)-based code translation approach for automated compliance checking of building envelope energy efficiency. Analysis of energy code for building envelope design in Hong Kong is first conducted to identify data sources and key intermediate checking requirements. Based on the identification, atomic methods are selected, and nested program are created, which gives designers and architects the flexibility to reuse these nodes to build or update relevant checking rules. Finally, an architecture of VPL-based energy code translation for overall thermal transfer value (OTTV) checking is presented for future verification of the performance of our approach.

These requirements are typically conveyed in voluminous written natural language texts requiring much expert interpretation. The compliance audit process has conventionally been a manual undertaking, which is known to be laborious, costly, and error-prone. In an era of increased legislation and electronic representations of products, it is prudent that some of these manual processes should be automated. This paper describes the capabilities of an automated compliance audit framework that can be incorporated into the compliance management of a product lifecycle. Apart from the product data model that is subject to audit, essential components of the framework include machine-readable legal knowledge and executable audit process models, support for supplementary human input and interface with simulation tools.

The information extraction processes in those ACC systems are based on either human interpretation, manual annotation, or predefined automated information extraction rules. Despite the high performance they showed, rule-based information extraction approaches, by nature, lack sufficient scalability-the rules typically need some level of adaptation if the characteristics of the text change. Machine learning-based methods, instead of relying on hand-crafted rules, automatically capture the underlying patterns of the existing training text and have a great capability of generalizing to a variety of texts. A more scalable, machine learning-based approach is thus needed to achieve a more robust performance across different types of codes/documents for automatically generating semantically-enriched building-code sentences for the purpose of ACC. To address this need, this paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for generating semantically-enriched building-code sentences, which are annotated syntactically and semantically, for supporting IE. For improved robustness and scalability, the proposed approach uses transfer learning strategies to train deep neural network models on both general-domain and domain-specific data. The proposed approach consists of four steps: (1) data preparation and preprocessing; (2) development of a base deep neural network model for generating semantically-enriched building-code sentences; (3) model training using transfer learning strategies; and (4) model evaluation. The proposed approach was evaluated on a corpus of sentences from the 2009 International Building Code (IBC) and the Champaign 2015 IBC Amendments. The preliminary results show that the proposed approach achieved an optimal precision of 88%, recall of 86%, and F1-measure of 87%, indicating good performance.

Transportat Res Board				For the design of asphaltic paving mixtures under heavy traffic loading, the Superpave system specifies use of performance-based mixture tests and prediction models to supplement volumetric mix design procedures. Central to the mechanics-based thermal cracking model used in Superpave is the prediction of thermally induced stresses based on a master curve and shift factor concept. The original version of Superpave had procedures for automated construction of the mixture creep compliance master curve from measured mixture properties. However, recent studies have indicated the need for several new modeling techniques, the development of which has resulted in the need for substantially more sophisticated procedures for automated construction of the master curve. This paper details the development of a computer program called MASTER, which automates master curve construction using built-in logic capabilities designed to handle the wide variety of measured responses encountered in practice. MASTER was found to agree closely with manually determined shift factors for 36 field mixtures investigated. The program was also found to be extremely robust, producing rational shift factors even when used to analyze complicated, thermally damaged materials. On the basis of these findings, the procedures developed here are recommended for inclusion in future revisions of the Superpave performance modeling software.

Generalized Adaptive Framework for Computerizing the Building Design Review Process	JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						Automated design review; Automated code checking; Building information modeling (BIM); Industry Foundation Classes (IFC); Generalized adaptive framework	CODES	Engineering design review is the process of assessing a design against codes and standards requirements to validate the accuracy and quality of the design and detecting problems before manufacturing and assembly begin. Building design regulations are normally in the form of texts, charts, tables, and mathematical expressions. These regulations and guidelines usually have legal status. Nevertheless, the cognitive and logical ability of the people is dissimilar to anything executed in computing machines. Consequently, the computerization of this process represents an actual challenge to the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. Most of the cited methods for automated rules compliance auditing are either based on proprietary, domain-specific, or hard-coded rule-based representations, which may be useful in their specific applications. However, these methods have the disadvantages of being costly to maintain, cumbersome to modify, and lacking a comprehensive schema of rules and regulations modeling that can adapt to different domains, and thus don't support an open data standard. They are often denoted as black box or gray box methods. This work offers a new comprehensive framework that reduces the deficiencies of the current approaches. The primary goal is to tackle the problem by concentrating on establishing a generalized adaptive framework (GAF) for a neutral data standard [such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)] that enables automation of building design review processes to achieve design accuracy and efficiency.

An important complexity while performing this task is that the information pertaining to a compliance requirement may be scattered across several provisions that are related via cross references. [Question/Problem] Prior research highlights the importance of determining and accounting for the semantics of cross references in legal texts during requirements elaboration, with taxonomies having been already proposed for this purpose. Little work nevertheless exists on automating the classification of cross references based on their semantic intent. Such automation is beneficial both for handling large and complex legal texts, and also for providing guidance to analysts. [Principal ideas/results] We develop an approach for automated classification of legal cross references based on their semantic intent. Our approach draws on a qualitative study indicating that, in most cases, the text segments appearing before and after a cross reference contain cues about the cross reference's intent. [Contributions] We report on the results of our qualitative study, which include an enhanced semantic taxonomy for cross references and a set of natural language patterns associated with the intent types in this taxonomy. Using the patterns, we build an automated classifier for cross references. We evaluate the accuracy of this classifier through case studies. Our results indicate that our classifier yields an average accuracy (F-measure) of approximate to 84 %.

Governmental regulations, business requirements and trust are among the reasons why enterprises require certain levels of security compliance from cloud providers. So far, security compliance or auditing information has been generated manually by security specialists. This involves manual data collection and assessment, which is slow and expensive. Thus, there is a need for an automated security compliance tool (ASCT) to verify and express the compliance of various cloud providers. Such a tool can reduce the human intervention and eventually reduce the cost and time by verifying the compliance automatically. Also, the tool will enable transparency of the cloud vendors to the customers which in turn will help grow confidence on the cloud vendors. Having these goals in mind, we have developed an architecture to build an ASCT for a cloud computing platform. We have also outlined four possible approaches to achieve this automation. These possible four approaches refer to four data collection mechanisms to collect data from the cloud systems and these are: API, vulnerability scanning, log analysis and manual entry. Finally, we have implemented a proof-of-concept prototype of this ASCT based on the proposed architecture. The prototype is integrated with OpenStack cloud platform and the results are exposed using the CloudAudit API.

Each functionality needs to be tested in order to verify datasheet compliance. Testing time and effectiveness need to the improved, due to the close 40% testing costs out of the total product cost. This is achieved by using highly automated mixed signal test platforms and multiple chip test approach. Present work introduces the prerequisites of a low cost automated mixed signal test platform. It is developed in order to provide test functionality from independent schematic and concept to full product validation. The presented platform is built in order to fill the validation necessities of design and test engineers, by providing adaptability to multiple circuit topologies, easiness in adding test modules and facilitating the connectivity process. The platform is comprised of multiple modules that function alongside with dedicated laboratory equipment.

J	Shahi, K; McCabe, BY; Shahi, A				Shahi, Kamellia; McCabe, Brenda Y.; Shahi, Arash			Framework for Automated Model-Based e-Permitting System for Municipal Jurisdictions	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						e-Permitting; Model-based; Building information modeling (BIM); Code compliance checking; GIS integration; Smart urban management; City planning	BUILDINGS; ADOPTION; TRACKING; NETWORK	Recent technological advances in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, including the implementation of building information modeling (BIM) and automated data-capturing tools, have enabled the AEC industry to commence its digital journey in the era of big data. Over the last decade, e-permitting practices have been introduced in many municipal jurisdictions around the world, aimed at replacing the traditional and inefficient paper-based practices. In this paper, these recent international developments are investigated, and three distinct levels of e-permitting are defined based on their varying levels of automation and integration. A framework is then developed that considers the impact of each level of e-permitting on the entire life cycle of the project, from submission of permitting document through construction, operation, and maintenance of the built facility. The developed framework can be used as a road map for any municipality for advancing from traditional paper-based permitting practices (Level 0) to a fully integrated city planning tool (Level 3), thus enabling several smart urban management applications, including city-level planning reviews, integrated logistics planning, and smart urban asset management. The framework as a whole was validated by a group of experts on construction permitting practices. Specific elements of its lower levels have been implemented by municipalities around the world, which have reported significant productivity improvements. Finally, this paper investigates several barriers to implementing the higher levels of e-permitting, along with corresponding strategies for municipalities to mitigate and overcome these challenges.

To automate the compliance checking process, such design information should be automatically extracted from the BIM and matched to the energy rules. This paper proposes an information extraction method for automated extraction of design information from BIMs, and a semantic matching method for automated matching of the extracted information to the energy rules. The Revit API was used to export the design information captured in a Revit model to an industry foundation classes (IFC) data model format. EXPRESS-based information extraction methods and Java-based post-processing techniques were used to parse the exported IFC data model and extract the design information to an intermediate semantic representation. A semantic matching method was developed and used to select the design information that matches/relates to the energy rules. The algorithms for extraction and matching of design information to energy rules were tested and evaluated using the BIM of an educational building and a set of rules extracted from energy codes. A performance of 98.0% recall and 89.2% precision was achieved in matching, which shows that the proposed methods are effective in automatically extracting design information from BIMs and matching the information to energy rules.

J	Zhou, P; El-Gohary, N				Zhou, Peng; El-Gohary, Nora			Domain-Specific Hierarchical Text Classification for Supporting Automated Environmental Compliance Checking	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Automated compliance checking; Semantic systems; Automated construction management systems; Natural language processing; Text classification; Machine learning	ONTOLOGY	Automated environmental compliance checking requires automated extraction of rules from environmental regulatory textual documents such as energy conservation codes and EPA regulations. Automated rule extraction requires complex text processing and analysis for information extraction and subsequent formalization of the extracted information into computer-processable rules. In the proposed automated compliance checking (ACC) approach, the text is first classified into predefined categories before information extraction (IE). The advantages are that irrelevant text will be filtered out during text classification (TC) and text with similar semantic meaning will be grouped, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of further IE and compliance reasoning (CR). The categories used for TC are predefined in a semantic TC topic hierarchy, and the classified text is subsequently used in semantic IE and semantic CR. This paper presents the proposed machine learning (ML)-based TC algorithm for classifying clauses in environmental regulatory documents based on the TC topic hierarchy. In developing the algorithm, different text preprocessing techniques, ML algorithms, and performance improvement strategies were tested and used. The final TC algorithm was tested on 10 environmental regulatory documents and evaluated in terms of precision and recall. The algorithm achieved approximately 97 and 84% average recall and precision, respectively, on the testing data.

C	Han, CS; Kunz, JC; Law, KH		Wang, KCP		Han, CS; Kunz, JC; Law, KH			A hybrid prescriptive-/performance-based approach to automated building code checking	COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Computing Congress Held in Conjunction with ASCE Annual Convention and Exposition on Information Technologies in Civil Engineering - Leading the World	OCT 18-21, 1998	BOSTON, MA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Tech Council Comp & Informat Technol, Comm Coordinat Outside ASCE				In design standards and building codes such as the Uniform Building Code (UBC) (ICBO94) or the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) (ADAAG97), introductory provisions state the design intent or performance issues of a section, and subsequent prescriptive statements (provisions) outlining the methods to satisfy the design intent. Currently, prescriptive provisions are necessary to explicitly define a standard method to measure the design intent of a section of a design standard. As the provision statement becomes more prescriptive, the design intent is often lost or not fully captured. Consequently, ambiguity and inconsistency arise, thus making the design standard difficult to parse not only by computers, but for humans as well. This paper examines a design-intent approach to design standards processing to alleviate some of the difficulties and complexities of the code due to its prescriptive nature. By focusing on the design intent, it is possible to negate the problems of indeterminacy and conflicting provisions in a building code. There are two major aspects to our design intent approach to design standards processing. First, capture the design intent per each section of the code. Second, formulate and model an adequate performance test of the design intent. The approach is to model the building code's prescriptive statements where there is no indeterminacy and conflict, whereas when such problems surface, a performance-based approach is adapted. This work focuses on disabled access building code issues.

Code compliance checks are essential since they standardize the functions a building must fulfill finally. Currently, these controls are cumbersome and error-prone and performed to a large extent manual by the planning consultants as well as authority officers. To enable an automation, the contents of the applicable guidelines have to be translated into a digital format, which can be read, interpreted and applied by machines. Various approaches focused on a textual or hard-coded translation of the guidelines. To increase the involvement of non-programming users, we introduced the visual code checking language, which uses a visual notation to represent the content of directives machine-as well as human-readable. In the presented paper, the authors present a refinement of the VCCL to increase the coverage rate of the translation capabilities.

Regulation information is an important factor for initial architectural design evaluations. The purpose of this study is to develop an automated system that designers and owners can check the evacuation regulation compliance of BIM data. In this study, the scope of applied regulation information is confined to evacuation regulation, as high-rise and complex building design has high priority and is critical on adequate disaster prevention systems and egress routes. To achieve this purpose, the authors have investigated case studies of BIM-based regulation checking process and illustrated the possible mechanism for the process through evacuation regulation analysis. Based on the presented methodology and scenario of the proposed automated evacuation regulation checking system, the authors developed a prototypical system, called InSightBIM-Evacuation.

Intelligent automation technologies have a strong potential to automate routine work and to balance resource use across safety risk management and other pharmacovigilance activities. While emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) show great promise for improving pharmacovigilance with their capability to learn based on data inputs, existing validation guidelines should be augmented to verify intelligent automation systems. While the underlying validation requirements largely remain the same, additional activities tailored to intelligent automation are needed to document evidence that the system is fit for purpose. We propose three categories of intelligent automation systems, ranging from rule-based systems to dynamic AI-based systems, and each category needs a unique validation approach. We expand on the existing good automated manufacturing practices, which outline a risk-based approach to artificially intelligent static systems. Our framework provides pharmacovigilance professionals with the knowledge to lead technology implementations within their organizations with considerations given to the building, implementation, validation, and maintenance of assistive technology systems. Successful pharmacovigilance professionals will play an increasingly active role in bridging the gap between business operations and technical advancements to ensure inspection readiness and compliance with global regulatory authorities.

J	Zhang, RCA; El-Gohary, N				Zhang, Ruichuan; El-Gohary, Nora			A deep neural network-based method for deep information extraction using transfer learning strategies to support automated compliance checking	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Code checking; Information extraction; Deep learning; Transfer learning		Existing automated compliance checking (ACC) systems require the extraction of requirements from regulatory documents into computer-processable representations. These information extraction (IE) processes are either fully manual, semi-automated, or automated. Semi-automated and manual approaches typically use manual annotations or predefined IE rules, which lack sufficient flexibility and scalability; the annotations and rules typically need adaptation if the characteristics of the regulatory document change. There is, thus, a need for a fully automated IE approach that can achieve high and consistent performance across different types of regulatory documents for supporting ACC. To address this need, this paper proposes a deep neural network-based method for deep IE - extracting semantic and syntactic information elements - from regulatory documents in the architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) domain. The proposed method was evaluated in extracting information from multiple regulatory documents in the AEC domain. It achieved average precision and recall of 93.1% and 92.9%, respectively.

Increasing regulation and need for reduced time-to-market has led enterprises to look to technology to scale and automate their compliance efforts. Automated compliance checking approaches proposed in research need human experts to formally encode rules, as well as to extract the relevant data from enterprise data stores. We present a modeldriven architecture (MDA) and method to semi-automate generation of formal rules and extraction of relevant data for compliance checking, based on OMG's MDA methodology. We demonstrate how building a fact-oriented model of the regulation is central to both relating it to the enterprise as well as deriving formal specification of rules. We illustrate our approach using a real-life case study of the MiFID-2 financial regulation.

Compared to existing alignment efforts, which are either manual or semi-automated, the proposed method aims to automate the alignment process for supporting fully automated energy compliance checking. A first-level simple alignment method is proposed to align single design information instances to single regulatory concepts, in which (1) domain knowledge is used for interpreting the meaning of concepts to recognize candidate instances, and (2) deep learning is used for capturing the semantics behind the words to measure semantic similarity and select the matches. A final complex alignment method is proposed to recognize the instance groups belonging to a regulatory requirement, in which (1) supervised and unsupervised searching algorithms are used to identify the instance pairs, and (2) network modeling is used to group and link the instance pairs to the requirement. The proposed method showed 93.4% recall and 94.7% precision on the testing data.

J	Nahangi, M; Haas, CT				Nahangi, Mohammad; Haas, Carl T.			Automated 3D compliance checking in pipe spool fabrication	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Point cloud registration; As-built status; Laser scanning; Staged fabrication; Quality assessment	IMAGE REGISTRATION METHODS; PROGRESS MEASUREMENT; CAD MODEL; CONSTRUCTION; SIMULATION; QUALITY; RECONSTRUCTION; VISUALIZATION; IMPACT; ERROR	In pipe spool assemblies used in construction, pre-fabrication errors inevitably occur due to the complexity of the tasks involved in the pipe spool fabrication process, the inaccuracy of the tools employed for performing these tasks, human error, and inadequate inspection and monitoring,during the process. Permanent deflections may also occur during shipment and transportation. After delivery at construction sites, defective spools must be detected and further consideration given to the erection of the spools to tolerance levels specified; otherwise, the repair and realignment associated with rework can cause schedule delays and consequent substantial costs increases. This paper presents an automated approach for monitoring and assessing fabricated pipe spools using automated scan-to-BIM registration. Defects are detected through a neighborhood-based Iterative Closest Point (ICP) approach for the registration process. While this technique can be broadly employed, this paper focuses on industrial construction facilities with particular emphasis on pipe spool assemblies. Experiments show that the proposed approach can be employed for the automatic and continual monitoring of such assemblies throughout fabrication, assembly and erection to enable timely detection and characterization of deviations. The main contribution of the work presented in this paper is an automated 3D inspection framework and algorithms for construction assemblies in general and pipe spools in particular.

It depends on the architects' knowledge, leading to possible errors. On the other hand, the rule checking in BIM-modeled building projects opens up new horizons for this type of activity. Based on Code Checking concepts, this paper presents a method for automating rule checking for building code in building architectural design of PT. Following the aspects of Design Science Research, it is developed in two stages: Construction (theoretical foundation, creating rule checking for the PT, implementation of the rules in BIM softwares for code checking and validation) and Evaluation of artefact. This paper shows a series of problems resulting from the evaluation of PT using traditional methods. It can be concluded that the use of rules for regulatory code checking with BIM allows standardization in the evaluation of architectural design of PT.

These IP cores have to fulfill defined quality characteristics. Conformance to these characteristics has to be checked automatically, as the increase in complexity makes manual checks infeasible. This article introduces IP quality aspects and describes the IP qualification platform which is able to check quality characteristics of digital soft IP. In order to distribute qualified IP it is essential to introduce an IP exchange process. More than 80% time and resource savings are expected through automated IP delivery which is based on a general IP transfer format. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Webb, P; Eastwood, SJ				Webb, P; Eastwood, SJ			An evaluation of a TI2 manufacturing system for the machining of airframe subassemblies	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART B-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANUFACTURE			English	Article						aerospace manufacturing; photogrammetry; machining		The commercial aircraft manufacturing industry is continually seeking new techniques for the automation of manufacturing and assembly tasks in the construction of aero-structures. The application of automation is limited by the size and compliance of the structures, the low manufacturing volumes and the inherent dimensional variability between assemblies. New automated systems based on the use of advanced control systems and non-contact metrology are now beginning to overcome some of these problems and the use of automation is becoming more viable. The TI2 system is one such system and this paper presents the results obtained from its application to the machining of a representative airframe subassembly. Real results are presented along with a discussion of some of the problems that may be encountered when using such a system.

The development of mutual trust depends on immutable, traceable, and transparent construction quality information records. However, current information technologies cannot meet the requirements. To address the challenge, this study explores a blockchain-based framework for construction quality information management, which extends applications of blockchain in the domain of construction quality management. A consortium blockchain system is designed to support construction quality management in which participants' information permissions and lifecycle are discussed. Additionally, this study presents in detail the consensus process that aims to address the problem of information fraud. The automated compliance checking based on smart contracts is presented as well, aiming to assure that construction products meet regulation requirements. Finally, an example of the consortium blockchain network is visualized to validate the feasibility of blockchain-based construction quality information management. The research shows that blockchain can facilitate mutual trust in construction quality management by providing distributed, encrypted, and secure information records and supporting automated compliance checking of construction quality.

J	Nawari, NO				Nawari, Nawari O.			A Generalized Adaptive Framework (GAF) for Automating Code Compliance Checking	BUILDINGS			English	Article						BIM; IFC; automated code compliance checking; generalized adaptive framework	INFORMATION; MODEL	Building design review is the procedure of checking a design against codes and standard provisions to satisfy the accuracy of the design and identify non-compliances before construction begins. The current approaches for conducting the design review process in an automatic or semi-automatic manner are either based on proprietary, domain-specific or hard-coded rule-based mechanisms. These methods may be effective in their specific applications, but they have the downsides of being costly to maintain, inflexible to modify, and lack a generalized framework of rules and regulations modeling that can adapt to various engineering design realms, and thus don't support a neutral data standard. They are often referred to as Black Box' or Gray Box' approaches. This research offers a new comprehensive framework that reduces the limitations of the cited methods. Building regulations, for instance, are legal documents transcribed and approved by professionals to be interpreted and applied by people. They are hardly as precise as formal logic. Engineers, architects, and contractors can read those technical documents and transform them into scientific notations and software applications. They can extract any data they need, reason about it, and apply it at various phases of the project. How these extraction and use are carried out is a critical component of automating the design review process. The chief goal is to address this issue by developing a Generalized Adaptive Framework (GAF) for a neutral data standard (Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)) that enables automating the code compliance checking processes to achieve design efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The objectives of this study comprise i) to develop a theoretical background to an adaptive framework that supports a neutral data standard for transforming the written code regulations and rules into a computable model, and ii) to define the various modules required for computerizing of the code compliance verification process.

J	Zhong, BT; Gan, C; Luo, HB; Xing, XJ				Zhong, Botao; Gan, Chen; Luo, Hanbin; Xing, Xuejiao			Ontology-based framework for building environmental monitoring and compliance checking under BIM environment	BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Building environmental monitoring; BIM; Ontology; Compliance checking; Semantic web	INFORMATION MODELING BIM; FACILITY MANAGEMENT; CONSTRUCTION; INDUSTRY; DESIGN; SYSTEM; GIS	Building environmental monitoring and compliance checking are important in ensuring environmental performance. The information required for monitoring and checking is obtained from different data sources in different information systems. In this context, information sharing between stakeholders and the semantic interoperability that prevails with varying information systems are necessary. However, the implementation of information sharing and semantic interoperability can be a challenge. This paper proposes an ontology-based framework to support environmental monitoring and compliance checking under building information modeling (BIM) environment among different information systems. The framework integrates building information from BIM, environmental information provided by sensors, and regulatory information based on building regulations and design requirements. In this framework, four specific ontologies are developed to represent relevant knowledge. Building information is extracted from BIM and then converted, together with environmental information provided by sensors, into resource description framework format as ontology instances. The regulation clauses are transformed into SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) rules. A case study is performed to apply the framework, and environmental monitoring and automated compliance checking are implemented in the context of a real distributed energy station project. The testing results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

The room-by-room calculations required to demonstrate compliance with the Indoor Enviromental Quality (IEQ) prerequisites and credits, starting from the building geometry and use and the HVAC technical data, may be time consuming and error-prone. With Building Information Modeling (BIM) all the required data can be incorporated into the design model, thus speeding up the process, automate the design validation and minimize the errors. The research explored the use of BIM for the Mechanical design following the LEED IEQ P1 and IEQ C2 qualification, and the automation of calculus for the verification process with the use of Dynamo visual scripting tool for the data exchange between Autodesk Revit and electronic spreadsheets.

Specifically, we introduce: 1) VeriCoq-IFT, an automated PCHIP framework for information flow policies and 2) VeriCoq-H, a hierarchy-preserving Verilog-to-Coq converter. VeriCoq-IFT aims to: 1) automate the process of converting designs from an HDL to the Coq formal language; 2) generate security property theorems ensuring compliance with information flow policies; 3) construct proofs for such theorems; and 4) check their validity in a design, with minimal user intervention. VeriCoq-H, on the other hand, seeks to convert the entire functionality of a Verilog design to its Coq representation while preserving design hierarchy. It facilitates the development of hierarchical proofs and enables the construction of hybrid module libraries containing the HDL code and the corresponding reusable lemmas for each module. Applicability of our automated VeriCoq-IFT framework is demonstrated by evaluating trustworthiness of two DES encryption circuits and several genuine and Trojan-infested advanced encryption standard (AES) designs, along with the utility of VeriCoq-H in preventing malicious modification of sensitive data, such as the secret key of an encryption circuit.

J	Kim, K; Teizer, J				Kim, Kyungki; Teizer, Jochen			Automatic design and planning of scaffolding systems using building information modeling	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Building information modeling; Design and construction planning; Geometric reasoning for automated modeling; Rules and regulations; Safety; Temporary facilities (scaffolding systems)	REPRESENTATION; RECOGNITION; CHECKING; SPACE	Considering their significant impact on construction projects, scaffolding as part of the temporary facilities category in construction must be thoroughly designed, planned, procured, and managed. The current practices in planning and managing scaffolding though is often manual and reactive, especially when a construction project is already underway. Widespread results are code compliance problems, inefficiency, and waste of procuring and managing material for scaffolding systems. We developed a rule-based system that automatically plans scaffolding systems for pro-active management in Building Information Modeling (BIM). The scope of the presented work is limited to traditional pipe and board scaffolding systems. A rule was prepared based on the current practice of planning and installing scaffolding systems. Our computational algorithms automatically recognize geometric and non-geometric conditions in building models and produce a scaffolding system design which a practitioner can use in the field. We implemented our automated scaffolding system for a commercially-available BIM software and tested it in a case study project. The system thoroughly identified the locations in need of scaffolding and generated the corresponding scaffolding design in BIM. Further results show, the proposed approach successfully generated a scaffolding system-loaded BIM model that can be utilized in communication, billing of materials, scheduling simulation, and as a benchmark for accurate field installation and performance measurement.

Ontology-based semantic modeling of regulation constraint for automated construction quality compliance checking	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction quality; Compliance checking; Regulation constraint; Ontology; Semantic modeling	INSPECTION; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEM; WEB	Regulations play an important role in assuring the construction quality. However, due to the large amount of regulation needs considered, the construction quality compliance checking against regulations can be cumbersome/time-consuming and error prone. In order to give more computerized support to the construction quality compliance checking against regulations, an ontology-based semantic modeling approach of regulation constraints is explored. A meta model for construction quality inspection and evaluation i.e. CQIEOntology is proposed in this paper. Based on CQIEontology, the regulation constraints are modeled into OWL axioms and SWRL rules. By these OWL axioms and SWRL rules, the regulation provisions imposed on construction quality inspection can be translated into a set of inspection tasks, and get associated with the specific construction tasks. Once the construction starts, the applicable inspection tasks, including a series of quality checking and evaluation, will be reminded and recommended. Obviously, the proposed approach facilitates taking the construction quality compliance checking as a paralleling activity to the construction rather than an afterthought, and helps the inspectors in quality inspection. Finally, the approach is demonstrated in Prot g 3.4.6 through case studies based on regulation examples taken from "Code for Acceptance of Construction Quality of Building Foundation (GB50202-2002) and the validation and discussion are given for it."

Data Protection regulations, like GDPR, mandate security controls to secure Personal Identifiable Information (PII) of the users which they share with service providers. With the volume of shared data reaching exascale proportions, it is challenging to ensure GDPR compliance in real time. We propose a novel approach that integrates GDPR Ontology with Blockchain to facilitate real time automated data compliance. Our framework ensures data operation is allowed only when validated by data privacy policies in compliance with privacy rules in GDPR. When a valid transaction takes place the PII data is automatically stored off-chain in a database. Our system, built using Semantic Web and Ethereum Blockchain, includes an access -control system that enforces data privacy policy when data is shared with third parties.

The secondary objective was to assess the impact of audio reminders and quantified individual feedback.Design.An observational comparison against manual assessment followed by assessment using an open-label randomized control method.Setting.Patient zones were established in 3 wards of 2 large teaching hospitals, including 88 general and 18 intensive care unit ward beds.Participants.Consented regular ward nursing, medical, and allied health staff.Methods.Concordance between 40 hours of manual observation using trained hand hygiene auditors and automated measures of opportunities and compliance. Subsequent measured interventions were reminder beeps and written individual feedback.Results.When compared with manual observations, ultrasound monitoring underestimated percentage compliances by a nonsignificant mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) difference of 5.2% (--20.1% to 9.8%; ). After the intervention, adjusted multivariate analysis showed mean (95% CI) overall compliance in the intervention arm was 6.8% (2.5%--11.1%; ) higher than in the control arm. Results stratified by compliance at entry and exit showed that the effect of intervention was stronger for compliance at exit than at entry.Conclusions.Our automated measure of hand hygiene compliance is valid when compared with the traditional gold standard of manual observations. As an interventional tool, ultrasound-based automated hand hygiene audits have significant benefit that can be built upon with enhancements and find increasing acceptance with time.

Model calibration is a term which refers to the improvement in the performance of a BEM simulation to better match the actual building in design or operation, which will in turn improve the results in using the BEMs in their various applications. Model calibration is particularly relevant in a building's operational stage considering that, as well as the number of dynamic elements involved in a building's performance on a day-to-day basis, buildings quite often perform differently to the initial design intent. Despite the benefits, model calibration is a time-consuming process which typically requires expert user knowledge. This paper details a methodology focused on improving and automating elements of the calibration process to address these current known limitations.

J	Joshi, KP; Banerjee, A				Joshi, Karuna Pande; Banerjee, Agniva			Automating Privacy Compliance Using Policy Integrated Blockchain	CRYPTOGRAPHY			English	Article						blockchain; Big Data; Semantic Web; privacy policy; ontology; knowledge graph; data compliance		An essential requirement of any information management system is to protect data and resources against breach or improper modifications, while at the same time ensuring data access to legitimate users. Systems handling personal data are mandated to track its flow to comply with data protection regulations. We have built a novel framework that integrates semantically rich data privacy knowledge graph with Hyperledger Fabric blockchain technology, to develop an automated access-control and audit mechanism that enforces users' data privacy policies while sharing their data with third parties. Our blockchain based data-sharing solution addresses two of the most critical challenges: transaction verification and permissioned data obfuscation. Our solution ensures accountability for data sharing in the cloud by incorporating a secure and efficient system for End-to-End provenance. In this paper, we describe this framework along with the comprehensive semantically rich knowledge graph that we have developed to capture rules embedded in data privacy policy documents. Our framework can be used by organizations to automate compliance of their Cloud datasets.

The VWOM is an automated method that optimizes the mass of structures with a given geometry, multiple deflection criteria and load cases. Members are selected from a predefined database to meet building code strength and stiffness criteria. Connections are modelled using rotational springs. The rotational stiffness of connections is varied from rigid to pinned. An example of a one-story building is used to explain the method. A four-story one-bay building is optimized for mass. All connections in the structure were assumed to have the same rotational stiffness. The VWOM produced results 44.6% lighter than results found in the literature.	[Elvin, A.; Strydom, J.

Various commercially-existing automated identification (ID) and information technologies (IT) were used to design a mobile Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) portal for checking the PPE compliance of personnel. When such gates are positioned at the entrance or within construction sites and once low-cost passive RFID tags are embedded or attached to PPE, automatic site access, time recording, and completeness control can be performed. These improve the logistics of the existing compliance checking process and provide users with timely feedback. Results to "personnel entering a construction site" demonstrate how the safety process, especially the awareness among personnel wearing PPE, can be pro-actively managed and controlled. Data further suggests the limitations of the developed approach and its potential for gathering leading safety indicator data. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Gao, H; Zhong, BT; Luo, HB; Chen, WY				Gao, Han; Zhong, Botao; Luo, Hanbin; Chen, Weiya			Computational Geometric Approach for BIM Semantic Enrichment to Support Automated Underground Garage Compliance Checking	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Computational geometry; Semantic enrichment; Compliance checking; Building information modeling; Underground garage	MODELS	The need for manual semantic annotation to domain-specific building information modeling (BIM) models limits the application of BIM technology in various architecture, engineering, and construction fields. BIM semantic enrichment refers to a procedure that can identify missing information and improve interoperability across different applications. The need for semantic enrichment of BIM models is often emphasized in the literature; however, few studies have shown the potential of semantic enrichment approaches in dealing with problems in real-world cases. To provide an empirical demonstration in the practice, an example of BIM semantic enrichment for supporting underground garage compliance checking is selected as a case study. Geometric reasoning is one of the effective approaches to enhance semantic information in BIM models to support real-world applications. In this study, a computational geometric approach is developed to demonstrate how geometric information can be extracted and used to infer missing semantics in underground garage BIM models. A prototype system is developed, and real underground garage BIM models are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The contribution of this study is that it provides the detailed implementation of performing geometric reasoning to enhance BIM semantics in real-world cases. Additionally, the findings of this case study show that the proposed computational geometric approach has the potential to enhance the semantics of BIM models to support decision making in real-world engineering problems, and the developed algorithms can be used to automate the compliance checking process of the underground garage.

Current 3D imaging sensors provide massive amounts of spatial data that remain underutilized due to the prohibitively time-consuming manual process of extracting usable information. Desired information is typically centered on a specific object of interest within 3D images, so there is a need for construction specific object recognition processes. In this paper, we present an automated method for locating and extracting pipe spools in cluttered point cloud scans. The method is based on local data level curvature estimation, clustering, and bag-of-features matching. Experimental results from two point clouds containing pipe spool objects demonstrate the method's ability to successfully extract spools from cluttered scenes as well as differentiate between similar spools in a single scene.

Recent efforts in the area of augmented data analytics have proposed the use of templates to facilitate the analysis of text. However, most of these efforts have constructed such templates manually, which is labor-intensive. More importantly, it is difficult for manually-developed templates to capture the linguistic variations in building codes. More research is, thus, needed to automate the generation of templates to support the tagging and extraction of information from building codes. To address this need, this paper proposes an unsupervised machine-learning based method to extract sentence templates that describe syntactic and semantic features and patterns from building codes. The proposed method is composed of four main steps: (1) data preprocessing; (2) identifying the different groups of sentence fragments using clustering; (3) identifying the fixed parts and the slots in the templates based on the syntactic and semantic patterns of the sentence fragment groups; and (4) evaluating the extracted templates. The proposed method was implemented and tested on a corpus of text from the International Building Code. An accuracy of 0.76 was achieved.

The meaning of requirements is analyzed in a building project context as a basis for data flow analysis: what are the main types of requirements, how they are handled, and what sources they originate from. A literature review has been conducted to find the present development directions in quality checking, besides a market research on present, already widely used solutions. With the conclusions of these research and modern data management theory, the principles of a holistic approach have been defined for quality checking in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. A comparative analysis has been made on current BIM compliance checking solutions according to our review principles. Based on current practice and ongoing research, a state-of-the-art BIM quality control ecosystem is proposed that is open, enables automation, promotes interoperability, and leaves the data governing responsibility at the sources of the requirements. In order to facilitate the flow of requirement and quality data, we propose a model for requirements as Linked Data and provide example for quality checking using Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL). As a result, an opportunity is given for better quality and cheaper BIM design methods to be implemented in the industry.

However, one concern with such systems is compliance; users fail to achieve daily stress reduction goals because goals are too easy or too difficult. To address this, we built DStress (Design for Stress), a theoretically grounded system that sets adaptive goals in three coaching dimensions: Exercise, Meditation and Accessibility. DStress modifies goal-difficulty based on the individual's immediately previous performance. In a 28-day deployment with 65 users, DStress reduced scores on one direct measure of stress almost in half, significantly more than two other non-adaptive coaching strategies. However, on a second direct stress measure, no improvement was found. There were also no improvements on other indirect stress measures. Analysis of 2842 user-generated reports suggests our findings were the result of DStress balancing compliance against the degree of challenge of the goals it would set.

The Federal Acquisition Regulations System (FARS) within the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) includes facts and rules for individuals and organizations seeking to do business with the US Federal government. Parsing and gathering knowledge from such lengthy regulation documents is currently done manually and is time and human intensive. Hence, developing a cognitive assistant for automated analysis of such legal documents has become a necessity. We have developed semantically rich approach to automate the analysis of legal documents and have implemented a system to capture various facts and rules contributing towards building an efficient legal knowledge base that contains details of the relationships between various legal elements, semantically similar terminologies, deontic expressions and cross-referenced legal facts and rules. In this paper, we describe our framework along with the results of automating knowledge extraction from the FARS document (Title 48, CFR). Our approach can be used by Big Data Users to automate knowledge extraction from Large Legal documents.

LEVELS OF BIM COMPLIANCE FOR MODEL HANDOVER	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building Information Modelling (BIM); Facilities Management (FM); compliance review; owner requirements; model handover	BUILDING INFORMATION	The important process of design review, compliance checking and project handover information intake and processing have traditionally been paper based and manual tasks. These tasks are onerous and error prone. Moreover, they do not allow effective detection of design issues and validation of project information quality for handover which lead to waste of resources when performing maintenance and repairs during operations. Building Information Modeling has the potential to help owners overcome these challenges by enabling seamless exchange of project information between design, construction, and operations while supporting and proving opportunities for automated design reviews. However, this practice has yet to fully take root in the industry due to its relative novelty. The research project presented in this paper set out to understand how owners could adopt and implement BIM to support design and information handover review. Two large public owner organizations were investigated over five years to support this aim. The findings are articulated around three levels of compliance for the owner's project and BIM requirements. The findings on compliance review suggest three elements: model structure verification, model content verification and design compliance review. These three elements rely on model queries which are identified through investigation of owner's operational requirements. The presented research connects modeling practice to support facilities maintenance, owner's information requirements, and owner's design requirements and leverages this information for model based compliance review.

J	Bloch, T; Sacks, R				Bloch, Tanya; Sacks, Rafael			Comparing machine learning and rule-based inferencing for semantic enrichment of BIM models	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building information modeling; Semantic enrichment; Machine learning	CLASSIFICATION; CONSTRUCTION; DESIGN; SPACE	The need for extensive pre-processing to prepare model data for sophisticated BIM applications, such as automated code compliance checking, functional simulation and analysis, and information exchange, is a major obstacle to their use. Semantic enrichment offers an alternative, automated approach to manual pre-processing. We illustrate the use of machine learning algorithms for semantic enrichment of BIM models, and compare it to rule-inferencing, through application to the problem of classification of room types in residential apartments. The results showed that machine learning is directly applicable to the space classification problem. Although rule-inferencing has succeeded in other contexts, it proved to be unsuitable for this problem. This leads to the observation that different BIM object classification problems require different approaches. More generally speaking, the Al methods used for semantic enrichment depend on the nature of the problem context, and future research will be needed to establish suitable guidelines.

More than 1,500 individual blasts were completed in the removal of over 200,000 m(3) of rock, lying directly over an existing metro station, and within meters of two museums, two hotels, the Helsinki transformer station, and several other sensitive buildings. An automated vibration-monitoring network was installed, incorporating 37 discrete monitoring points located in nearby metro locations and surrounding facilities. After every blast, vibration data was automatically transferred from the monitoring network to a server database, and made accessible on a password-protected website. The data was also imported into a semi-automated Scaled Distance tool, and analysis was done using linear regression immediately following each blast. Engineers first verified that the recorded levels were in compliance with established limits, and then used the analysis to determine, and adjust for trends in blast-induced vibration.

J	Wang, M; Altaf, MS; Al-Hussein, M; Ma, YS				Wang, Meng; Altaf, Mohammed Sadiq; Al-Hussein, Mohamed; Ma, Yongsheng			Framework for an IoT-based shop floor material management system for panelized homebuilding	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Barcode; building information modelling (BIM); enterprise resource planning (ERP); Internet of things (IoT); Panelized construction	MODULAR BUILDINGS; PERFORMANCE; SIMULATION; INTERNET	Panelized construction, an emerging offsite construction method, is garnering increasing attention globally particularly for wood-frame wall panels as an advanced construction technology. Although utilizing this advanced construction method can greatly improve the working environment and productivity, the conventional mentality in construction, which historically overlooks the value of an automated management system to support off-site prefabrication and on-site installation, hinders its application. This research introduces an Internet of things (IoT)-based shop floor material management system that can capture dynamic data in real-time and effectively synthesize it along the supply chain. With the assistance of a feature-based modelling method, real-time information can be merged into an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system rather than manually inputting data. Through the research presented in this article, IoT-based shop floor material management is shown to be highly effective in addressing dynamic changes in a cost-effective manner. As demonstrated in a case study, the proposed system can lead to cost reduction, improved efficiency, and improved compliance with just-in-time (JIT) inventory management principles.

These predictions are tested against an archetypal range of household operation figures that are based on the data collected of approximately 400 households monitored for 11 months each. This study identifies that standardising the simulations by using the archetypal range of dwelling occupation predictions produces a more consistent outcome in energy evaluation across both software packages. However, both of the BIM software packages tested in this study are unable to establish energy performance predictions that align with the real-world measured data. This suggests that in-built semi-automated simulation measures, beyond the optimised schedules and occupancy profiles, investigated in this study, need to be examined in greater detail.

At the moment building products markets are full of various types of panels by produced different manufactures but skinned with one and the same material only. Panels skinned with two different types of materials are widely used in the sphere of transport. It may be also of considerable economical effect in building engineering. The article presents an analysis of the current state of the problem of calculation of thin-walled profiles in load-bearing structures. The authors developed a program of automated calculation of three-layer panels. The program is certified in Russia. The program allows you to optimize the panel parameters according to the cost criterion. The article presents the basic calculation ideas incorporated in the algorithm of the program. The figures show the program interface. To date, the program has only one Russian language interface. The paper introduces automated methods of single- and multi-span sandwich panels trial design. Different types of materials can be used while skinning these panels. Their middle layer shift and compliance of supporting structures are taken into account.

Unfortunately, ATN is not widely adopted because of the complexity and multiformity of negotiation policies, especially in virtual computing environment, where the situation becomes worse than in traditional computing environment, due to the fact that a host with multiple virtual machines needs to be deployed with multiple negotiation policies. Moreover, all of these policies for each virtual machine must be upgraded and checked. To ease the burden on the administrator when deploying ATN access control policies and credentials in virtual computing environment, we propose an automated trusted negotiation architecture called virtual automated trust negotiation (VATN) to centralize ATN policies and credentials for multiple virtual machines in a physical node into a privileged virtual machine. VATN puts policy compliance checker and credential verification control in each virtual machine to improve the execution efficiency of trust negotiation. We implement VATN in Xen virtualization platform. Finally, we discuss the correctness of policy consistency checking and make performance analysis of VATN implemented in Xen.

Furthermore, construction quality information is still recorded on paper, with the risk of document loss and data manipulation, jeopardizing quality accountability. Blockchain has attracted increasing attention from the construction industry because it can record information in an immutable and transparent way and automate some businesses with smart contracts. These properties can tackle information fraud and improve the automation level of OCQI. Unfortunately, very few documented blockchain solutions for OCQI exist. To fill the theoretical knowledge gap, the design thinking approach was adopted to present a blockchain-based conceptual framework. The consortium network and Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) were selected as the suitable blockchain type and development platform for OCQI. The consensus process in HLF and smart contracts-based compliance checking are illustrated. Moreover, the benefits of integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) and ontology technology with blockchain are analyzed in detail, which can facilitate the coevaluation of these three technologies. Finally, a prototype system was developed to vividly show the theoretical feasibility. The proposed blockchain solution can be fine-tuned and evaluated in future research. Challenges hindering the practical implementation of blockchains are systematically discussed within the technology-organization-environment (TOE) theory, which can be reused in future investigations to identify construction stakeholders' concerns on adopting blockchains.

This study reviews ontology research mainly published in the Scopus database from 2007 to 2017 with the combination of scientometric analysis and critical review. Scientometric analysis (e.g. co-author, co-word, co-citation, and clusters) objectively visualized the research status quo while a critical review was used to identify the research themes and challenges of ontology research in the construction industry. The results identified a large network of co-authors in this field to understand collaboration relationships. Over half the papers (53%) were published by the following three countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The top co-occurring keywords were "project management" at which ontology facilitates knowledge management and information retrieval. When the time factor was taken into consideration, keywords naturally evolved from "project management", and "knowledge management" to "building information modeling", and "compliance control" with the successful adoption of information techniques in the construction industry. Four research themes were identified with the combination of cluster analysis and critical review: "Domain ontology", "Industry foundation classes", "Automated compliance checking", and "Building information modeling". This review provides an in-depth understanding of existing ontology research and indicates the emerging trends in this research domain.

ROBUST CLASSIFICATION AND SEGMENTATION OF PLANAR AND LINEAR FEATURES FOR CONSTRUCTION SITE PROGRESS MONITORING AND STRUCTURAL DIMENSION COMPLIANCE CONTROL	ISPRS GEOSPATIAL WEEK 2015	ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	ISPRS Geospatial Week	SEP 28-OCT 03, 2015	La Grande Motte, FRANCE	WG III 2 Point Cloud Proc, WG V III Terrestrial 3D Imaging & Sensors, WG VII 7 Synergy Radar, ISPRS		Point Cloud Segmentation; Construction Site Progress Monitoring; Robust Statistics; Deterministic Minimum Covariance Determinant; Complete Linkage	SIMPLIFICATION; ALGORITHM; OUTLIERS	The application of terrestrial laser scanners (TLSs) on construction sites for automating construction progress monitoring and controlling structural dimension compliance is growing markedly. However, current research in construction management relies on the planned building information model (BIM) to assign the accumulated point clouds to their corresponding structural elements, which may not be reliable in cases where the dimensions of the as-built structure differ from those of the planned model and/or the planned model is not available with sufficient detail. In addition outliers exist in construction site datasets due to data artefacts caused by moving objects, occlusions and dust. In order to overcome the aforementioned limitations, a novel method for robust classification and segmentation of planar and linear features is proposed to reduce the effects of outliers present in the LiDAR data collected from construction sites. First, coplanar and collinear points are classified through a robust principal components analysis procedure. The classified points are then grouped using a robust clustering method. A method is also proposed to robustly extract the points belonging to the flat-slab floors and/or ceilings without performing the aforementioned stages in order to preserve computational efficiency. The applicability of the proposed method is investigated in two scenarios, namely, a laboratory with 30 million points and an actual construction site with over 150 million points. The results obtained by the two experiments validate the suitability of the proposed method for robust segmentation of planar and linear features in contaminated datasets, such as those collected from construction sites.

Enabling easier navigation and handling of cross references requires automated support for the detection of the natural language expressions used in cross references, the interpretation of cross references in their context, and the linkage of cross references to the targeted provisions. In this article, we propose an approach and tool support for automated detection and resolution of cross references. The approach leverages the structure of legal texts, formalized into a schema, and a set of natural language patterns for legal cross reference expressions. These patterns were developed based on an investigation of Luxembourg's legislation, written in French. To build confidence about their applicability beyond the context where they were observed, these patterns were validated against the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) by the Government of Ontario, Canada, written in both French and English. We report on an empirical evaluation where we assess the accuracy and scalability of our framework over several Luxembourgish legislative texts as well as PHIPA.

To be in compliance with the law digital forensic evidence must be preserved and examined for possible system attacks. As the sophistication of the attacks increases, the security system must also evolve while at the same time remaining simplistic enough for the average system administrator to use. Combining powerful forensic tools with deliverable visual snapshots provides such a system.

In the last decade, the performance of computer vision using trained deep neural networks has outperformed previous approaches based on careful feature engineering. However, the opaqueness of large ML models is a substantial impediment for critical applications such as in the automotive context. As a remedy, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) has been proposed to provide visual explanations of model internals. In this paper, we demonstrate how Grad-CAM heatmaps can be used to increase the explainability of an image recognition model trained for a pedestrian underpass. We argue how the heatmaps support compliance to the EU's seven key requirements for Trustworthy AI. Finally, we propose adding automated heatmap analysis as a pipe segment in an MLOps pipeline. We believe that such a building block can be used to automatically detect if a trained ML-model is activated based on invalid pixels in test images, suggesting biased models.

Over 50 billion USD worth such systems are more than 20 years old resulting in their hardware having become outdated. Yet the process remains very little altered. These legacy systems need to be migrated to newer hardware and software platforms to ensure support and compliance to current standards. The time elapsed has resulted in shortage of subject matter and system experts available to understand the nitty gritties of the process functionality implementation in the legacy system using control language of that era. Documentation, if at all existing, is as built and not as running. Hence there is a need to generate documentation that could be understood by current generation automation and process engineers from the back-up of the running legacy system. This paper proposes a novel software tool to generate documents from the legacy industrial control system hack-up. We test it with a real legacy system and verify the documents with actual hack up. This helps in brownfield engineering migration projects.	[Sudarsan, Sithu D.; Mohan, Devina] ABB Corp Res, Bangalore, Karnataka, India; [Rohit, S.

METHOD OF CALCULATION FLEXURAL STIFFNESS OVER NATURAL OSCILLATIONS FREQUENCIES	ARCHIVES OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Dynamics; building system; frequency of natural oscillations; flexural stiffness; finite-element method		The actual load-bearing capacity of elements of a building system can be calculated by dynamic parameters, in particular by resonant frequency and compliance. The prerequisites for solving such a problem by the finite element method (FEM) are presented in the article. First, modern vibration tests demonstrate high accuracy in determination of these parameters, which reflects reliability of the diagnosis. Secondly, most modern computational complexes do not include a functional for calculating the load-bearing capacity of an element according to the input values of resonance frequencies. Thirdly, FEM is the basis for development of software tools for automating the computation process. The article presents the method for calculating flexural stiffness and moment of inertia of a beam construction system by its own frequencies. The method includes calculation algorithm realizing the finite element method.

Facilitating the BIM coordinator and empowering the suppliers with automated data compliance checking	EWORK AND EBUSINESS IN ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION			English	Proceedings Paper	11th European Conference on Product and Process Modelling (ECPPM)	SEP 07-09, 2016	Limassol, CYPRUS					In projects with Building Information Modelling (BIM), the collaboration among the various actors is a very intricate and intensive process. The various suppliers and engineers provide their input in Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which in turn is used for design coordination. However, the IFCs have to undergo an intermediate checking process to ensure compliance with various client-set and technical requirements. The paper focuses on the potential of (semi-) automatic IFC compliance checks and discusses a relevant recent initiative in the Netherlands, according to which several IFC compliance criteria were agreed among 14 contractors. This study aims to unravel the changes induced by this development not only as to the IFC compliance checks, but also as to potentially balancing the roles between the BIM coordinator and the suppliers.

J	Mathur, A				Mathur, Ajay			Public costs and private benefits: the governance of energy efficiency in India	BUILDING RESEARCH AND INFORMATION			English	Article						building regulations; buildings; energy demand; energy efficiency; energy policy; governance; local authorities; India		India has demonstrated that it is possible to reduce energy demand and increase the energy efficiency of its buildings, particularly for air-conditioning appliances. Given the rapid and large expected increase in India's building stock over the next 20 or more years, the opportunity exists to make significant increases in overall energy efficiency and reduce energy demand through the application of its Energy Conservation Building Code that influences the design, construction and operation of buildings. However, the responsibility for this code resides with local authorities (urban local bodies) that currently lack sufficient incentive to implement and enforce it. To overcome this impediment, it is argued here that important benefits can be captured by local authorities to implement energy-conservation measures: increased revenues from taxes, improved attractiveness to business and citizens, and the introduction of automation to reduce transaction costs in the building-approval process. Large parts of the country's property (real estate) are yet to be built, providing a valuable opportunity to transition to low-energy and climate-friendly solutions in India's rapidly growing building stock.

An SOA deals with distributed software services that interact with each other. By adopting an SOA in cooperation with a Business Process Management System (BPMS) we aimed at increased efficiency and control, shorter setup times, and increased flexibility. We used open source or free products where possible, and the end result is a professional architecture suitable for small-scale to medium-scale media enterprises. Key concepts are the use of JMS as messaging layer for asynchronous, long-running service interactions (which are typical in a media production environment), the orchestration of services leading to processes with more business meaning, the graphical description of these business processes followed by the automatic generation of executable code (BPEL), support for human interactions in the processes and compliance with the WS-I Basic Profile 1.1. Our architecture is illustrated with a use case in which we automated a process that deals with the intake, review, transcoding and publishing of user-generated content.

Hand hygiene with alcohol-based hand rubs are measures currently in use to prevent horizontal transmission of infections. The extent of compliance with hand hygiene regulations is unclear and difficult to monitor. Methods: We built an automated monitoring system with a pressure sensor attached to the alcohol-based hand rubs containers. Wireless fidelity (WIFI)-assisted data collection took place over 9 weeks. Interventions included posters, email reminders and newsletters. Hand hygiene compliance before and after these interventions was evaluated. Results: Overall compliance with hand hygiene regulations was 6.48%; half of the physicians participating in our study performed hand hygiene at only 3.08% of patient visits. Twenty-four (17.9%) physicians performed hand hygiene with high compliance (>= 10%), while 11.2% performed no hand hygiene at all. Physicians in academic positions and those with >= 20 years of experience performed hand hygiene less frequently than did other physicians. Compliance with hand hygiene regulations improved from 6.08% to 6.73% (P < .001) after intervention. Discussion: Compliance with hand hygiene among physicians in our outpatient clinics was very low and needs to improve. Conclusions: Interventions improved the compliance somewhat, although additional interventions including education, training and feedback were suggested.

Despite strong enforcement of construction best practices and regulations, accidents in construction industry are comparatively higher than other industries. Likewise, significant increase in injuries and fatalities are recently reported on geotechnical activities such as excavation pits and trenches. Academic researchers and industry professionals have currently devoted vital attention to acquire construction safety in preconstruction phase of the project. They have developed various algorithms to enhance safety in preconstruction phase such as automated generation of scaffolding and its potential risk analysis, checking BIM model for fall risks, and limited access zone allocation in wall masonry. However, safety in geotechnical works at preconstruction phase is yet unexplored. This paper proposed automatic safety rule compliance approach for excavation works leveraging algorithmic modeling tools and BIM technologies. The focused approach comprises of the following three modules: information extraction and logic design (IELD), information conversion and process integration (ICPI), and automodeling and safety plan generation (ASPG). Specifically, the scope of the paper is limited to major risks such as cave-ins, fall, safety egress, and prohibited zones risks. A set of rules-based algorithms was developed in commercially available software using visual programming language (VPL) that automatically generates geometric conditions in BIM and visualizes the potential risks and safety resources installation along with their quantity take-off and optimized locations. A case study has been presented to validate the proof of concept; automated modeling tool for excavation safety planning generated the required results successfully. It is anticipated that the proposed approach has potential to help the designers through automated modeling and assist decision makers in developing productive and practical safety plans compared to the conventional 2D plans for excavation works at the preconstruction phase. Moreover, it is realized that the same approach can be extended to other rule-dependent subjects in construction.

These requirements define safe condition, including arrangement of equipment and acceptable values of energy consumption or production. Monitoring compliance with with safe operating mode is performed as result of comparison of the current status and safe power system. A necessary condition to determine a current state of the electricity system is the use of automated information-measuring system, which enables saving values of power consumption with a resolution of less than an hour. The aim of the study is to build models of safe state of the electro-energy system, which are the benchmark for comparison of current conditions. On the example of Chelyabinsk CHPP-2, which exploits an "Energy" complex of technical means, the process of constructing models of safe states electrical energy system is described. The developed algorithm and program of monitoring compliance with a safe mode operation using models of safe conditions of power system has raised efficiency measures to ensure a safe operation of the equipment and the objectivity of working with staff at the Chelyabinsk CHP-2.

Little attention has however been paid to the problem of understanding non-compliance and improving business practices to prevent non-compliance in the future, a task that typically still requires human interpretation and intervention. Building upon work on automated detection of non-compliant situations, in this paper we propose a technique for the root-cause analysis of encountered problems and for the prediction of likely compliance states of running processes that leverages (i) on event-based service infrastructures, in order to collect execution evidence, and (ii) on the concept of key compliance indicator, in order to focus the analysis on the right data. We validate our ideas and algorithms on real data from an internal process of a hospital.

Automatic Recognition of Common Structural Elements from Point Clouds for Automated Progress Monitoring and Dimensional Quality Control in Reinforced Concrete Construction	REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						semantic object classification; point cloud segmentation; terrestrial laser scanner (TLS); progress monitoring; dimensional compliance control; reinforced concrete construction; 3D surface intersection; change detection; building information modeling (BIM)	3D BUILDING MODELS; RECONSTRUCTION; SEGMENTATION; TRACKING; SHAPE; OBJECTS; PLANAR	This manuscript provides a robust framework for the extraction of common structural components, such as columns, from terrestrial laser scanning point clouds acquired at regular rectangular concrete construction projects. The proposed framework utilizes geometric primitive as well as relationship-based reasoning between objects to semantically label point clouds. The framework then compares the extracted objects to the planned building information model (BIM) to automatically identify the as-built schedule and dimensional discrepancies. A novel method was also developed to remove redundant points of a newly acquired scan to detect changes between consecutive scans independent of the planned BIM. Five sets of point cloud data were acquired from the same construction site at different time intervals to assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework. In all datasets, the framework successfully extracted 132 out of 133 columns and achieved an accuracy of 98.79% for removing redundant surfaces. The framework successfully determined the progress of concrete work at each epoch in both activity and project levels through earned value analysis. It was also shown that the dimensions of 127 out of the 132 columns and all the slabs complied with those in the planned BIM.

A high-force, direct-drive linear electromechanical actuator has been developed which acts directly on the shift rails of either an Automated Manual Transmission (AMT) or a Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT) to facilitate gear selection and provide shift-by-wire functionality. It offers a number of advantages over electromechanical systems based on electric motors and gearboxes in that it reduces mechanical hysteresis, backlash and compliance, has fewer components, is more robust, and exhibits a better dynamic response.

An example is the automated monitoring systems that are currently being used to provide healthcare workers with feedback regarding their hand hygiene compliance. These solutions seem effective in promoting healthcare workers self-awareness and action regarding their hand hygiene performance, which is still far from desired. Underlying these systems, an indoor positioning component (following Internet of Things paradigm) is used to collect data from the ward regarding healthcare workers' position, which will be later used to make some assumptions about the usage of alcohol-based handrub dispensers and sinks. We found that building such a system under the scope of the healthcare field is not a trivial task and it must be subject to several considerations, which are presented, analyzed and discussed in this paper. The limitations of present Internet of Things technologies are not yet ready to address the demanding field of healthcare.

ENERGY AND BUILDINGS			English	Article						Whole-building energy simulation; Energy conservation measures; Parametric analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Calibration; Reporting; Quality-assurance; Visualization; Automation; Workflow		The OpenStudio software development kit has played a significant role in the adoption of the EnergyPlus whole building energy modeling engine and in the development and launch of new applications that use EnergyPlus for a variety of purposes, from design to auditing to code compliance and management of large portfolios. One of the most powerful features of the OpenStudio platform is Measure, a scripting facility similar to Excel's Visual Basic macros. Measures can be used to apply energy conservation measures to models-hence the name-to create reports and visualizations, and even to sew together custom workflows. Measures automate tedious tasks increasing modeler productivity and reducing error. Measures have also become a currency in the OpenStudio tools ecosystem, a way to codify knowledge and protocol and transfer it from one modeler to another, either within an organization or within the global modeling community. This paper describes some of the many applications of Measures. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Jaura, A; Osman, MOM; Krouglicof, N				Jaura, A; Osman, MOM; Krouglicof, N			Hybrid compliance control for intelligent assembly in a robot work cell	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH			English	Article							FORCE CONTROL; SYSTEMS	This paper introduces a novel approach of using Hybrid Compliance Control (HCC) in robotic assembly. The approach uses active implicit compliance control in conjunction with a Passive Compliance Device (PCD) for assembly tasks. The active control provides force feedback to enable the robot to follow an assembly path during task execution, and the PCD supplements corrections for instantaneous time-dependent assembly path uncertainties that arise from inherent errors in the system and manufacturing irregularities. This HCC strategy resulted in lesser force impact on the end effector during task executions, a higher number of successful assemblies, and did not significantly affect implementation costs. Experiments conducted to validate the HCC and the redundancy built in, displayed positive indicators, implying that the concept is transferable to automated assembly lines.

J	Gillespie, T				Gillespie, Tony			Good Practice for the Development of Autonomous Weapons Ensuring the Art of the Acceptable, Not the Art of the Possible	RUSI JOURNAL			English	Article							ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE	Advanced surveillance systems can autonomously identify military targets. A consequent automated decision to attack without human assessment and authorisation of the action will almost certainly be in breach of international law. Separating decisions and actions identifies the role of machine-made decisions and the human ability to assess them and to authorise action. High autonomy levels in a weapon system place new responsibilities on organisations and personnel at all stages of procurement and use. In this article, Tony Gillespie builds on recent UN expert discussions to propose that detailed legal reviews at all procurement stages, including pre-development, are needed to ensure compliance with international law. Similar reviews are also needed for automated systems in the decision-making process.

C	Kucukoguz, E; Su, JW		Bravetti, M; Bultan, T		Kucukoguz, Esra; Su, Jianwen			On Lifecycle Constraints of Artifact-Centric Workflows	WEB SERVICES AND FORMAL METHODS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Workshop on Web Services and Formal Methods	SEP 16-17, 2010	Stevens Inst Technol, Hoboken, NJ		Stevens Inst Technol		BUSINESS; VERIFICATION	Data plays a fundamental role in modeling and management of business processes and workflows. Among the recent "data-aware" workflow models, artifact-centric models are particularly interesting. (Business) artifacts are the key data entities that are used in workflows and can reflect both the business logic and the execution states of a running workflow. The notion of artifacts succinctly captures the fluidity aspect of data during workflow executions. However, much of the technical dimension concerning artifacts in workflows is not well understood. In this paper, we study a key concept of an artifact "lifecycle". In particular, we allow declarative specifications/constraints of artifact lifecycle in the spirit of DecSerFlow, and formulate the notion of lifecycle as the set of all possible paths an artifact can navigate through. We investigate two technical problems: (Compliance) does a given workflow (schema) contain only lifecycle allowed by a constraint? And (automated construction) from a given lifecycle specification (constraint), is it possible to construct a "compliant" workflow? The study is based on a new formal variant of artifact-centric workflow model called "ArtiNets" and two classes of lifecycle constraints named "regular" and "counting" constraints. We present a range of technical results concerning compliance and automated construction, including: (1) compliance is decidable when workflow is atomic or constraints are regular, (2) for each constraint, we can always construct a workflow that satisfies the constraint, and (3) sufficient conditions where atomic workflows can be constructed.

It will allow users to build a 1-U (10 cm x 10 cm x 11 cm, 1.33 kg) CubeSat-class spacecraft with a parts budget of approximately $5,000. Work is underway to develop software to assist users in configuring the spacecraft and validating its compliance with integration and launch standards. Each prospective configuration requires a unique software configuration, combining pre-built modules for controlling base components, custom control software for custom developed and payload components and overall mission management and control software (which, itself will be a combination of standard components and mission specific control logic). This paper presents a system for automating standard component configuration and creating templates to facilitate the creation and integration of components that must be (or which the developer desires to be) custom-developed for the particular mission or spacecraft.

Alex			Automated design of flexible linkers	DALTON TRANSACTIONS			English	Article							THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; SMILES; FLEXIBILITY; DISCOVERY; FRAMEWORK	This paper presents a method for the systematic and automated design of flexible organic linkers for construction of metal organic-frameworks (MOFs) in which flexibility, compliance, or other mechanically exotic properties originate at the linker level rather than from the framework kinematics. Our method couples a graph grammar method for systematically generating linker like molecules with molecular dynamics modeling of linkers' mechanical response. Using this approach we have generated a candidate pool of >59 000 hypothetical linkers. We screen linker candidates according to their mechanical behaviors under large deformation, and extract fragments common to the most performant candidate materials. To demonstrate the general approach to MOF design we apply our system to designing linkers for pressure switching MOFs-MOFs that undergo reversible structural collapse after a stress threshold is exceeded.

Bootstrapping Privacy Compliance in Big Data Systems	2014 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON SECURITY AND PRIVACY (SP 2014)	IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy		English	Proceedings Paper	35th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP)	MAY 18-21, 2014	San Jose, CA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc Techn Comm			INFORMATION-FLOW	With the rapid increase in cloud services collecting and using user data to offer personalized experiences, ensuring that these services comply with their privacy policies has become a business imperative for building user trust. However, most compliance efforts in industry today rely on manual review processes and audits designed to safeguard user data, and therefore are resource intensive and lack coverage. In this paper, we present our experience building and operating a system to automate privacy policy compliance checking in Bing. Central to the design of the system are (a) LEGALEASE-a language that allows specification of privacy policies that impose restrictions on how user data is handled; and (b) GROK-a data inventory for Map-Reduce-like big data systems that tracks how user data flows among programs. GROK maps code-level schema elements to datatypes in LEGALEASE, in essence, annotating existing programs with information flow types with minimal human input. Compliance checking is thus reduced to information flow analysis of big data systems. The system, bootstrapped by a small team, checks compliance daily of millions of lines of ever-changing source code written by several thousand developers.

J	Elvin, A; Strydom, J				Elvin, Alex; Strydom, Johnnie			Optimizing the Design of Tall Buildings Using the Principle of Virtual Work: The Effect of Semi Rigid Connections	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STEEL STRUCTURES			English	Article						Virtual work optimization method; Semi rigid connections; Automated member selection; Discrete sections; Design; Case studies	OPTIMUM DESIGN; FRAMES; ALGORITHM	The Virtual Work Optimization Method (VWOM) is used to optimize tall buildings with semi rigid connections. The VWOM is an automated method that minimizes the mass of a structure with a given geometry, deflection criteria and load cases, while adhering to building code requirements. Members are selected from a user defined database to meet strength and stiffness criteria. The rotational stiffness of connections can be specified and varied, from rigid to pinned. The method is explained using an example of a two storey one bay steel frame with six members. Four case studies are presented: (i) a six storey two bay frame, (ii) a ten storey one bay steel building, (iii) a fifteen storey three bay steel frame and (iv) a twenty four storey three bay building. The examples are compared to results found in the literature. Structures were optimized for a range of connection rotational stiffnesses. The VWOM obtained results up to 44.6% lighter than published work. Optimized results showed that in most cases the semi rigid connection produced the same results as the rigid connections. This is due to the rapid plateauing of the optimized mass as the connection stiffness increases. Thus, the typical definition of semi rigid and rigid rotational stiffnesses (for example Eurocode 3) are both found on this plateau. If some members are lightly loaded, broad semi rigid and rigid bands can be produced. The effect in these cases is that structures with rigid connections are lighter than those with semi rigid connections as no compensation in the member stiffness is required to meet deflection criteria.

J	AlOmani, A; El-Rayes, K				AlOmani, Abdullah; El-Rayes, Khaled			Automated generation of optimal thematic architectural layouts using image processing	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review						Thematic layout; Nature-inspired; Optimization; Algorithms; Segmentation; Regions; Automated	DESIGN; ALGORITHM	Thematic architectural layouts of many of the iconic buildings around the world were inspired by images from nature. This architectural design task is often complex and challenging as it requires the creation of optimal architectural layouts that resemble the selected image from nature while complying with all owner specified space allocation requirements. To support architects in this challenging task, this paper presents the development of a novel methodology to support architects and designers in automating the generation of thematic architectural layout designs that are inspired by images from nature. The methodology utilizes image processing to segment the nature-inspired image and analyze the segmented image to generate regions using region and boundary extraction algorithm. The methodology also integrates two novel optimization algorithms that are designed to optimize room assignments in the generated layout to maximize compliance with designer-specified adjacency requirements and optimize room areas to maximize the functional and operational performance of the architectural layout. An application example was analyzed to illustrate the use of the developed methodology and its novel capabilities in automating the generation of optimal thematic architectural layouts that preserve the image theme while complying with room adjacency and rooms area requirements.

A novel automated simulator of pediatric systemic circulation: Design and applications	BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL			English	Article						Automated simulator; In vitro testing; Pediatric cardiovascular system model; Pediatric ventricular assist devices	VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICE; CONTINUOUS-FLOW; MOCK CIRCULATION; CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS; HEART-FAILURE; PULSATILE; PRESSURE; SUPPORT; ARTERIAL; LOOP	The technology of ventricular assist devices has shown unprecedented evolution over the last decade. Despite of it, there is still a great need of developing pediatric specific devices, thus highlighting the demand for flexible simulators, capable of emulating mechanical circulatory assistance in the setting of pediatric heart failure. The aim of this work was to design and build an automated simulator of the pediatric circulation. The simulator comprises a hydraulic circulation mock loop and an electronic system with its computational algorithms and its graphical user interface. The simulator includes left ventricle assist devices capable of generating pulsatile or continuous-flow. To demonstrate the applicability of the automated system developed, normal and heart failure conditions of pediatric patients were simulated and the contribution of left ventricular assist devices in restoring normal hemodynamics were quantified. Restoration of aortic flow was obtained with the use of continuous or pulsatile devices in heart failure simulated conditions.

It is well-known that the safety hazards of these stairs lead to loss of lives in the past. In this context, within the scope of the study, physical conditions of external escape stairs of existing buildings were examined in terms of providing an easy and fast escape from the buildings during a fire, and reducing the risk on someone's life safety. Based on the results, suggestions for solutions were made to eliminate or reduce the potential risks of external escape stairs. It is assumed that these suggestions will be beneficial for preventing possible health problems and loss of lives occurred at the external escape stairs and minimizing the potential damages faced by the users. In this study, automated building code compliance checking system is used. First of all, the potential sources of hazard in the external escape stairs are identified. It is thought that identifying the sources that could pose a hazard for people during the evacuation from the building in case of a fire can be beneficial to ensure taking necessary fire safety measures. Within the scope of the study, safety hazards related to different sources that could affect the life safety of users were also determined These sources were subsumed under two categories: access and usage. Besides, the physical conditions of external escape stairs were analyzed in the context of fire-related codes, standards and regulations valid in Turkey, United States of America, England and Russia.

In this work, the causes for quality deficiencies in small building services installations as well as the structure of actors interacting with building services were analysed. On this basis, we developed a solution approach in the form of an information model including a catalogue of all requirements and the necessary content to address and improve the quality assurance of HVAC in small buildings. This information model will serve as the basis for future digital tools that can perform (partially) automated heating load calculations and the design of heating systems, improve installation logistics and installation quality through providing information and the necessary processing, and enable improved hydraulic balancing and control.

However, the nature of rules (expressed in natural language) and the large amount of elements that can be involved in them make their materialization and automated checking quite difficult. That is why the existing support for compliance checking is generally restricted to specific kinds of rules (e.g. rules affecting the control flow of the process). In this paper, we introduce compliance mashups, and show how a mashup-based approach can help solve the problem of rule specification and checking at design time. Some advantages of such an approach are that: (i) any kind of rule can be specified, which implies that each user can specify a rule according to his/her interpretation of the rule; (ii) building the compliance mashup is transparent to the formalism(s) used to implement it, so different techniques can be used together; and (iv) mashup components or parts of them can be re-used. As an example we use this approach to build mashups to specify and check rules related to human resource management in business processes at design time.

The goal of the work is to develop and evaluate tools for offline and online analysis of system metrics gathered from instrumentation in Internet server platforms. We use a promising class of probabilistic models (Tree-Augmented Bayesian Networks or TANS) to identify combinations of system-level metrics and threshold values that correlate with high-level performance states-compliance with Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for average-case response time-in a three-tier Web service under a variety of conditions. Experimental results from a testbed show that TAN models involving small subsets of metrics capture patterns of performance behavior in a way that is accurate and yields insights into the causes of observed performance effects. TANS are extremely efficient to represent and evaluate, and they have interpretability properties that make them excellent candidates for automated diagnosis and control. We explore the use of TAN models for offline forensic diagnosis, and in a limited online setting for performance forecasting with stable workloads.

Although energy performance certificates describe primary energy consumption and the associated emissions of a home or building, they do not consider the influence of building automation control systems (BACS) or technical building management (TBM) systems on these parameters. The European Standard EN 15232 remedies this shortcoming and evaluates the savings in primary energy and the reduction of CO2 emissions that can be achieved by these systems. This study investigates the energy performance certificates registered in the Autonomous Community of La Rioja and considers the policy changes in the Technical Building Code (codigo Tecnico de la Edificacion) and, specifically, the Basic Document for Energy Saving (Documento Basic de Ahorro de Energia) (CTE-DB-HE). Due to this regulatory change, we corrected the certificates and outlined different scenarios based on the implementation of these systems in this study. These scenarios show the potential distribution of energy performance certificates and the improvements in the ratings obtained. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The failure of constructed elements to fall within the specified tolerances may be the result of an unsatisfactory level of precision applied during construction or the inability to interpret the information provided in the specifications correctly. The consequences of improper dimensional quality control measures have adverse effects on the aesthetics of the elements, and, in severe cases, the structural strength of the elements. The dimensional quality control practices that are prevalent in today's industry do not only provide room for random errors associated with manual measurements, but also exploit two of the most valuable assets of a construction project: time and labor. Nevertheless, if appropriate steps are taken during the design phase, the majority of these tolerance issues during the construction phase can be prevented. Therefore, this study focuses on the tolerance issues arising during the construction phase by combining design BIM and tolerance specifications within the same database. A text-parsing algorithm in MATLAB environment was used to tag elements in an IFC Building Information Model (BIM) with textual-tolerance information. The output IFC BIM including textual-tolerance information would be used by project engineers and inspectors during the construction phase. This would enable access to all tolerance-compliance-related information within the same database, which would help make timely decisions to prevent rework and schedule delays.

Optimising structures using the principle of virtual work	JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						automated member selection; discrete sections	OPTIMIZATION; FRAMES; DESIGN	This paper presents a method for optimising structures with a given geometry and loading based on the principle of virtual work. The Virtual Work Optimisation Method, or VWOM, that was developed minimises the mass of the structure while meeting building code strength requirements, and flexibility (or deflection) criteria. The optimisation can be readily constrained by grouping together members with the same sectional properties. The VWOM automates most of the design process, obviating the requirement of experience and expertise in stiffening a structure. Three case studies were conducted using the VWOM: (i) the benchmark optimisation ten-member truss; (ii) a truss frame designed by professional engineers; and (iii) a 24-storey frame. The results of the VWOM were compared with published or available solutions. The VWOM produced structures that were 0,9 to 15,1% lighter than those produced by the methods used in the comparisons. If every member was allowed to have its own sectional properties, the VWOM found even lighter structures (by as much as 19,5%). The VWOM is less computationally expensive than the comparison methods, requiring two or three orders of magnitude fewer iterations to converge to the solution.

They thereby form an important building block in the development and testing of automated driving. In the last years, due to the General Data Protection Regulation of the EU, the usage of video has seen backlash from company internal compliance departments, as well as from the general public. Often, the video recorded of the external view includes features that concern the privacy of uninvolved third parties. These features include, but are not limited to, faces and license plates. In this paper, we present an approach to process these sensitive areas in the recorded videos. They are detected using state-of-the-art object detection and then made pseudonymous in a way that can be reverted if the video is used in a specially protected viewing or development environment. This way, the development of functions or systems that rely on these personal features can still be done. For all other use cases, the videos can be used without privacy concerns.

Through the GDPR, individuals are able to better control their personal data in the face of new technological developments. While the GDPR is highly advantageous to individuals, complying with it poses major challenges for organizations that control or process personal data. Since no automated solution with broad industrial applicability currently exists for GDPR compliance checking, organizations have no choice but to perform costly manual audits to ensure compliance. In this paper, we share our experience building a UML representation of the GDPR as a first step towards the development of future automated methods for assessing compliance with the GDPR. Given that a concrete implementation of the GDPR is affected by the national laws of the EU member states, GDPR's expanding body of case law and other contextual information, we propose a two-tiered representation of the GDPR: a generic tier and a specialized tier. The generic tier captures the concepts and principles of the GDPR that apply to all contexts, whereas the specialized tier describes a specific tailoring of the generic tier to a given context, including the contextual variations that may impact the interpretation and application of the GDPR. We further present the challenges we faced in our modeling endeavor, the lessons we learned from it, and future directions for research.

The current voice systems & recording systems are federated and make a basic assumption for reporting i.e. they assume that the numbers of calls received and recorded by call loggers are the same as the number of calls received by the voice system. This approach does not provide the true picture of recording compliance reporting leading to significant penalties. To bridge this gap, we propose in this paper an integrated deployment framework. The framework describes the way to establish data collection, computation and representation in automated way to avoid manual errors. In addition, the framework provides a mechanism to configure business rules to meet different reporting needs. This framework is independent of the recording solutions currently deployed in BPO industry. The paper also show cases, a demonstrable approach of building a "Compliance meter" based on the above framework. Compliance meter can be used in industry to address the reporting gaps.

J	Schwartz, Y; Raslan, R; Korolija, I; Mumovic, D				Schwartz, Yair; Raslan, Rokia; Korolija, Ivan; Mumovic, Dejan			A decision support tool for building design: An integrated generative design, optimisation and life cycle performance approach	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL COMPUTING			English	Article						Generative design; genetic algorithms; thermal simulation; life cycle; carbon; LCA; NSGA-II; building performance		Building performance evaluation is generally carried out through a non-automated process, where computational models are iteratively built and simulated, and their energy demand is calculated. This study presents a computational tool that automates the generation of optimal building designs in respect of their Life Cycle Carbon Footprint (LCCF) and Life Cycle Costs (LCC). This is achieved by an integration of three computational concepts: (a) A designated space-allocation generative-design application, (b) Using building geometry as a parameter in NSGA-II optimization and (c) Life Cycle performance (embodied carbon and operational carbon, through the use of thermal simulations for LCCF and LCC calculation). Examining the generation of a two-storey terrace house building, located in London, UK, the study shows that a set of building parameters combinations that resulted with a pareto front of near-optimal buildings, in terms of LCCF and LCC, could be identified by using the tool. The study shows that 80% of the optimal building's LCCF are related to the building operational stage (sigma = 2), while 77% of the building's LCC is related to the initial capital investment (sigma = 2). Analysis further suggests that space heating is the largest contributor to the building's emissions, while it has a relatively low impact on costs. Examining the optimal building in terms compliance requirements (the building with the best operational performance), the study demonstrated how this building performs poorly in terms of Life Cycle performance.

Our study indicates that the development of task-driven software interfaces could significantly support the processes and activities of Aboriginal council management and could contribute to alleviating the stress associated with current systems. Our vision is to develop these interfaces together with networking support for peer-to-peer collaboration between councils, compliance agencies and trusted advisers. The workflows themselves would be built and refined in a collaborative fashion between users together with some automated support.

Framing and Evaluating the Best Practices of IFC-Based Automated Rule Checking: A Case Study	BUILDINGS			English	Article						Automated Rule Checking (ARC); Building Information Modeling (BIM); Industry Foundation Classes (IFC); proactive design; smart design	CODE COMPLIANCE; BIM; KNOWLEDGE; SYSTEM; CLASSIFICATION	This research reviews recent advances in the domain of Automated Rule Checking (ARC) and argues that current systems are predominantly designed to validate models in post-design stages, useful for applications such as e-permitting. However, such a design-check-separated paradigm imposes a burden on designers as they need to iteratively fix the fail-to-pass issues. Accordingly, the study reviews the best-practices of IFC-based ARC systems and proposes a framework for ARC system development, aiming to achieve proactive bottom-up solutions building upon the requirements and resources of end-users. To present and evaluate its capabilities, the framework is implemented in a real-life case study. The case study presents all the necessary steps that should be taken for the development of an ARC solution from rule selection and analysis, to implementation and feedback. It is explained how a rule checking problem can be broken down into separate modules implemented in an iterative approach. Results show that the proposed framework is feasible for successful implementation of ARC systems and highlight that a stable data standard and modeling guideline is needed to achieve proactive ARC solutions. The study also discusses that there are some critical limitations in using IFC which need to be addressed in future studies.

In offices and homes, building automation systems are suited to individuals, foresighting their needs. Occupants' compliance is a fundamental requirement for a successful adoption of building automation systems. An important warning regards that such "smart behaviour" of the building should match with the occupants' satisfaction and their feeling of controlling the living environments. A balance between energy efficiency and occupants' needs is required.

Disassembly is currently carried out mainly by human operators. It is important to reduce the labor content of disassembly through automation, to make remanufacturing more economically attractive. Threaded fastener removal is one of the most difficult disassembly tasks to be fully automated. This article presents a new method developed for automating the unfastening of screws. An electric nutrunner spindle with a geared offset adapter was fitted to the end of a collaborative robot. The position of a hexagonal headed screw in a fitted stage was known only approximately, and its orientation in the hole was unknown. The robot was programed to perform a spiral search motion to engage the tool onto the screw. A control strategy combining torque and position monitoring with active compliance was implemented. An existing robot cell was modified and utilized to demonstrate the concept and to assess the feasibility of the solution using a turbocharger as a disassembly case study. Note to Practitioners-Remanufacturing is known to generate substantial economic, social, and environmental benefits. Disassembly is the first operation in a remanufacturing process chain. Unfastening threaded parts ("unscrewing") is a common disassembly task accounting for approximately 40% of all disassembly activity. Like other disassembly tasks, often, unscrewing has to be carried out manually in remanufacturing due to difficulties caused by the variable and unpredictable condition of the end-of-life (EoL) products to be remanufactured. Automating unscrewing operations should reduce the labor content of disassembly, thus lowering remanufacturing costs and promoting the adoption of remanufacturing. This article proposes the use of a collaborative robot to perform autonomous unfastening of hexagonal headed screws. Collaborative robots have built-in force sensors and can be programed to carry out operations involving not only position but also active force and compliance control. They can work safely alongside human operators, enabling the latter to focus on jobs requiring high cognitive or manipulation abilities. The article presents a novel spiral search technique developed to improve the rate of successful engagement between the robot end effector and the screw heads despite uncertainties in the location of the screws. The technique was successfully demonstrated on the dismantling of a turbocharger but can readily be applied to other EoL products with hexagonal headed screws. It can also be used with other kinds of screws (e.g., Phillips screws and slotted-head screws) simply by changing the tool and tuning the robot control parameters. A limitation of the proposed technique is that it can only deal reliably with undamaged screws. In our future research, we will consider screws that are in imperfect conditions through usage and develop appropriate solutions for their removal by robots.

The IFC schema needs to be extended to fully support ACC. Previous IFC extension efforts typically extended the IFC schema in a manual (which entailed an effort-intensive and largely subjective) manner. A more automated (thus, a less effort-intensive and more objective) method for extending the IFC is needed. To address this gap, a new method for finding concepts from domain documents to incorporate into the current IFC class hierarchy is proposed. In this new IFC extension method, machine learning (ML)-based relationship classification is used to predict the relationship between each pair of matched concepts. This paper focuses on presenting the ML-based relationship classification method and its testing results. In the proposed method, a supervised ML-based approach is taken to train a classifier to automatically identify the relationship (equivalent, super, sub, or associated concept) between a pair of concepts. Four main ML algorithms were tested, including Naive Bayes, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines. Eight syntactic and semantic features of concept pairs were used in training the classifiers. The performances of the different ML algorithms were compared based on their classification precision. The best performing algorithm achieved 88.2% precision.

However, since research projects can extract data about device owners that could be personal or sensitive, there are substantial privacy concerns. Currently, the only regulation to protect user privacy for research projects is through Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) from researchers' institutions. However, there is no guarantee that researchers will follow the IRB protocol. Even worse, researchers without security expertise might build apps that are vulnerable to attacks. In this work, we present a platform, Sensibility Testbed, for automated enforcement of the privacy policies set by IRBs. Our platform enforces such policies when a researcher runs code on mobile devices. The enforcement mechanism is a set of obfuscation layers in a secure sandbox, that can be customized for any level of IRB compliance, and can be augmented by policies set by the device owner.

J	de Albuquerque, JP; Krumm, H; de Geus, PL				de Albuquerque, Joao Porto; Krumm, Heiko; de Geus, Paulo Licio			Formal validation of automated policy refinement in the management of network security systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY			English	Article						Policy refinement; Model-based management; Formal validation; Security policies; Policy based management; Network security		Policy hierarchies and automated policy refinement are powerful approaches to simplify administration of security services in complex network environments. A crucial issue for the practical use of these approaches is to ensure the validity of the policy hierarchy, i.e. since the policy sets for the lower levels are automatically derived from the abstract policies (defined by the modeller), we must be sure that the derived policies uphold the high-level ones. This paper builds upon previous work on Model-based Management, particularly on the Diagram of Abstract Subsystems approach, and goes further to propose a formal validation approach for the policy hierarchies yielded by the automated policy refinement process. We establish general validation conditions for a multi-layered policy model, i.e. necessary and sufficient conditions that a policy hierarchy must satisfy so that the lower-level policy sets are valid refinements of the higher-level policies according to the criteria of consistency and completeness. Relying upon the validation conditions and upon axioms about the model representativeness, two theorems are proved to ensure compliance between the resulting system behaviour and the abstract policies that are modelled.

The complexity of ESD protection design can be enormous due to high degree of integration, including high signal count and mix-signal considerations. It is likely to take several design iterations before the specified ESD requirements can be guaranteed. [2] and [3]. In view of a shorter design cycle coupled with overwhelming technological challenges in the leading edge 90nm process, an automated tool (RVCAT-ESD) has been deployed for the verification of ESD design rules during the product development stage. The tool can effectively verify both local and global ESD protection rules on the design database. The tool is also capable of providing a panoramic view of the ESD violation nodes in the design layout using the "overlay" feature. This helps to efficiently pin-point ESD design weaknesses in the design layout, such as current congestion, insufficient metal width and etc. This allows ESD design rules compliance in the early design stage, thus enhancing the approach of "correct-by-construction" on ESD design.

Current compliance checking approaches neglect such information as it is not readily available in process models. Even if ACs are automatically analysed with audit software, the results still need to be linked to related processes. By now, this linking is not methodically supported. To address this gap this paper presents a method to automatically enrich process models with audit relevant information about ACs. The method consists of three phases: process model construction, automated analysis of ACs, and model enrichment. It utilizes two existing artefacts and combines them to provide a comprehensive basis for compliance checking. Moreover, the enriched process models can support auditors in conducting process audits in ERP environments.

It stems from the need to provide evidence on the behaviour of the system, compliance to requirements and timing bounds. The formal testing process is complicated, and includes tests to achieve compliance with certification requirements. Where possible, testing should be performed on a host and then validated on the target. This is especially important for real systems where the target may not be available early in the project or target-based testing is expensive and time consuming. Meaningful host-based testing is difficult when it comes to timing analysis. Automation helps reduce the costs and move testing earlier in the application development cycle. Moving testing earlier in the development cycle not only enables the testing to scale to whole systems, it allows the risks of projects to be managed and software to be optimised before target-based testing is performed. In this paper, we extend existing work achieving reliable coverage and High WaterMark (HWM) measurement, to scale its application to the analysis of a full system software build, automate the test process, and minimise the set of tests deployed on target. Our case study demonstrates the successful application of the approach on a large code base, i.e. an existing controls system software code. The paper ends with a position statement about how this work is instrumental for both future research but also as part of industry practically analysing the timing behaviour of systems automatically and certifying mixed-criticality systems.

A crucial part of the building permit process is the interpretation and transformation of natural language-based building regulation into a computer-readable and executable format. As other countries and their projects have developed a certain type of rule-translation methods, KBimCode, part of the KBim application series, has been developed and supported by the Korean government to ignite an automatic, BIM-based building permit system on top of the current e-submission system, which is called Seumter. The rule translation process usually employs a computer hard-coded approach because of its ease of implementation, and there have been advances in making the computer understand the natural language-based building regulations using parametric input tables and script languages. This project includes a step for developing a logic rule-based approach for translating natural language into computer-executable code. However, the main contribution of this study is the introduction of an approach to represent such text-based regulations using visual language for novice programmers, architects, and rule reviewers. This paper describes a KBimCode visual language that is easy-to-write and intuitive because it uses visual symbols instead of textual coding.

This is to both increase operational efficiency as well as maximize occupant comfort and environmental impact. However, these "smart devices" - typically used with default settings - also enable the capture and sharing of a variety of sensitive and personal data about the occupants. Given the non-intrusive nature of most IoT devices, individuals have little awareness of what data is being collected about them and what happens to it downstream. Even if they are aware, convenience overrides any privacy concerns, and they do not take sufficient steps to control the data collection, thereby exacerbating the privacy paradox. At the same time, IoT-based building automation systems are revealing highly sensitive insights about the building occupants by synthesizing data from multiple sources and this can be exploited by the device vendors and unauthorised third parties. To address the tension between privacy and convenience in an increasingly connected world, we propose a user-centric informed consent model to foster an accurate user discretion process for privacy choice in IoT-enabled smart buildings. The proposed model aims to (a) inform and increase user awareness about how their data is being collected and used, (b) provide fine-grained visibility into privacy compliance and infringement by IoT devices, and (c) recommend corrective actions through nudges (or soft notifications). We illustrate how our proposed consent model works through a use case scenario of a voice-activated smart office.

J	Zhou, P; El-Gohary, N				Zhou, Peng; El-Gohary, Nora			Ontology-Based Multilabel Text Classification of Construction Regulatory Documents	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								In order to fully automate the environmental regulatory compliance checking process, rules should be automatically extracted from applicable environmental regulatory textual documents, such as energy conservation codes. In the authors' automated compliance checking (ACC) approach, prior to rule extraction, the text is first classified into predefined categories to only retrieve relevant clauses and filter out irrelevant ones, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of rule extraction. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been commonly used for text classification (TC). Nonontology-based, ML-based TC has, generally, performed well. However, given the need for an exceptionally high performance in TC to support high performance in ACC, further TC performance improvement is needed. To address this need, an ontology-based TC algorithm is proposed to further improve the classification performance by utilizing the semantic features of the text. A domain ontology for conceptualizing the environmental knowledge was used. The proposed ontology-based TC algorithm was tested on 25 environmental regulatory documents, evaluated using four evaluation metrics, and compared with the authors' previously utilized ML-based approach. Based on the testing data, the results show that the ontology-based approach consistently outperformed the ML-based approach, under all evaluation metrics.

The entries in the catalogue have been recently migrated to a new relational database whose data model adheres to the conceptual models promoted by the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA), in particular, to the FRBR and FRAD specifications. The database content has been later mapped, by means of an automated procedure, to RDF triples which employ basically the RDA vocabulary (Resource Description and Access) to describe the entities, as well as their properties and relationships. This RDF-based semantic description of the catalogue is now accessible online through an interface which supports browsing and searching the information. Due to their open nature, these public data can be easily linked and used for new applications created by external developers and institutions. The methods applied for the automation of the conversion, which build upon open-source software components, are described here.

J	Delhi, VSK; Sankarlal, R; Thomas, A				Delhi, Venkata Santosh Kumar; Sankarlal, R.; Thomas, Albert			Detection of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Compliance on Construction Site Using Computer Vision Based Deep Learning Techniques	FRONTIERS IN BUILT ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						construction safety; personal protective equipment; deep learning; object recognition; convolutional neural networks; computer vision	PREVENTION MEASURES; SAFETY; VISUALIZATION; TRACKING; RECOGNITION; ISSUES	Construction safety is a matter of great concern for practitioners and researchers worldwide. Even after risk assessments have been conducted and adequate controls have been implemented, workers are still subject to safety hazards in construction work environments. The need for personal protective equipment (PPE) is important in this context. Automatic and real-time detection of the non-compliance of workers in using PPE is an important concern. Developments in the field of computer vision and data analytics, especially using deep learning algorithms have the potential to address this challenge in construction. This study developed a framework to sense in real-time, the safety compliance of construction workers with respect to PPE, which is intended to be integrated into the safety workflow of an organization. The study makes use of the Convolutional Neural Networks model, which was developed by applying transfer learning to a base version of the YOLOv3 deep learning network. Taking into account the presence of hardhat and safety jackets, the model predicts compliance in four categories such as NOT SAFE, SAFE, NoHardHat, and NoJacket. A data set of 2,509 images was collected from video recordings from several construction sites and this web-based collection was used to train the model. The model reported an F1 score of 0.96 with an average precision and recall rate at 96% on the test data set. Once a non "SAFE" category is detected by the model, an alarm and a time-stamped report are also incorporated to enable a real-time integration and adoption on the construction sites. Overall, the study provides evidence on the feasibility and utility of computer vision-based techniques in automating the safety-related compliance processes at construction sites.

Study on Energy Savings by using Efficient Utilites in Buildings	2015 COMMUNICATION, CONTROL AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS (CCIS)			English	Proceedings Paper	2015 Communication Control and Intelligent Systems (CCIS)	NOV 07-08, 2015	Mathura, INDIA	GLA Univ, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Inst Engn & Technol, IEEE, UP Sect		ECBC; Energy Efficiency; Scheduled Control; Two Room Building Model		India's Energy consumption rate has increased in 21st century due to its economic growth and steady rise in GDP. The energy demand is increased due to evolution of new electronic gadgets to improve the life style. India's Energy consumption in residential buildings is about 40 percent of total. There is a 30 to 40 percent of energy saving opportunities existing in this sector with minimum efforts. India framed Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) to adopt energy conservation methods in buildings. In this paper, we demonstrate the energy savings with efficient utilities compared to conventional ones through a real time two room building model. Two identical rooms in a building have been considered in which one is equipped with highly efficient utilities whereas the other room with conventional utilities of same capacity. In addition to that, the scheduled controlling mechanism is also implemented in energy efficient room to automate as well as to increase the energy savings further. From the investigations, it is concluded that the visual comfort has been increased by 25 percent and power savings by 57 percent in lighting system of efficient room. Further, it is also observed that 18 percent of energy is saved by using efficient fans. With efficient lighting, fans and air conditioning systems, overall room energy efficiency has been improved by 25 percent. In future, renewable energy sources and advance control strategies will be incorporated to make building net zero energy and green buildings.

J	Arcuri, N; De Ruggiero, M; Salvo, F; Zinno, R				Arcuri, Natale; De Ruggiero, Manuela; Salvo, Francesca; Zinno, Raffaele			Automated Valuation Methods through the Cost Approach in a BIM and GIS Integration Framework for Smart City Appraisals	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						building information modeling; geographic information systems; real estate appraisal; cost approach; smart cities	SPATIAL DEPENDENCE; PRICES	The principle behind sustainable city movements is represented by the idea of "good living", which is the possibility of having solutions and services that allow citizens to live in an easy, simple, and enjoyable way. Policies for urban quality play a central role in the slow cities manifesto, often suggesting the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ITC) in the development of interactive services for citizens. Among these, an interesting possibility is to offer citizens digital real estate consultancy services through the implementation of automated evaluation methods. An automated appraisal action-which is already complex in itself owing to the need to collect data in a consistent, standardized, but also differentiated way so as to require the adoption of real estate due diligence-collides on the operational level with the concrete difficulty of acquiring necessary data, much more so since the reference market is dark, atypical, and viscous. These operational difficulties are deepened by the epistemological nature of the appraisal discipline itself, which bases its methodology on the forecast postulate, recalling the need to objectify as much as possible the evaluation from the perspective of an intersubjective sharing argument. These circumstances have led, on the one hand, to the definition of internationally accepted uniform evaluation rules (IVS, 2017) and, on the other, to the testing of automated valuation methods aimed at returning computer-based appraisals (AVM). Starting from the awareness that real estate valuation refers essentially to information and georeferences, this paper aims to demonstrate how real estate appraisal analysis can be further improved through information technology (IT), directing real estate valuation towards objectivity in compliance with international valuation standards. Particularly, the paper intends to show the potential of combining geographic information systems (GISs) and building information models (BIMs) in automated valuation methods through the depreciated reproduction cost. The paper also proposes a BIM-GIS semi-automatic prototype based on the depreciated reconstruction cost through an experimentation in Rende (Italy).

C	Cater, SJ; Ahn, DB; Quigley, D			IEEE	Cater, Stuart James; Ahn, Dohyung B.; Quigley, David			Automation of satellite requirement verification	2006 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-9	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	2006 IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 04-11, 2006	Big Sky, MT					Satellite manufacturers have to verify the compliance of their product to the customer's requirements through a comprehensive and extensive testing regime. These tests are performed at various stages of satellite construction and integration through the execution of test procedures on a wide variety of test equipment. The process to update the requirement verification status is usually manual. This process is laborious, repetitive and mundane; therefore is prone to error. This paper(1,2) discusses how the Manufacturing and Operations Information System (MOIS) is being enhanced to interoperate with the Dynamic Object-Oriented Requirements System (TM) (DOORS (TM)) and the Integrated Test and Operations System (ITOS) to provide an automated verification environment called the Integrated Satellite Test Suite (ISTS). This suite will facilitate the development of test procedures; their association with the requirements from which they are derived; the execution of these procedures on a typical test platform; the automatic association of the verification status; and the generation of requirements verification documentation. It will also be demonstrated how the use of the integrated Configuration Management tools assist in the management of the satellite manufacturing process.

By providing a machine-based checking process the tool ModelCheck was rolled out to meet demands emerged during pilot projecting. Thus it is capable of processing automated compliance checks on quality criteria for the authorities, e. g. documentation guidelines of BBR regarding building and real estate documentation or building information modeling (BIM) quality criteria formed for the Humboldt-Forum project - a BIM pilot-project managed by BBR. ModelCheck supports checks on IFC models - formal against schemes and logical inspection with regards to alpha-numeric content by using xml-based configurable rules.

J	Haussler, M; Esser, S; Borrmann, A				Haeussler, Marco; Esser, Sebastian; Borrmann, Andre			Code compliance checking of railway designs by integrating BIM, BPMN and DMN	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review						BIM; Infrastructure; Quality; Railway; Design; Code compliance checking; BPMN; DMN	MODEL	Code compliance checking has been the subject of scientific research for more than four decades and has been put into practice in numerous projects. To date, however, no universally valid, sustainable approach to the rulebased compliance checking of models has been established. Visual programming languages are easier to understand and thus more transparent than textual formats. The study presented here analyzes the requirements specified in the guidelines of the Deutsche Bahn AG regarding the technical design of structures in railway construction and examines the feasibility of implementing these rules using BPMN and DMN. The rules analyzed are categorized into 12 different classes. Depending on the guideline subset, the BPMN/DMN approach was found to be useable in 37%-75% of the 943 rules examined. Considering only those rules that are relevant for the digital railway model, 68% of the rules can be represented and automated using BPMN and DMN.

J	Krishnan, G; Kim, C; Kota, S				Krishnan, G.; Kim, C.; Kota, S.			Building block method: a bottom-up modular synthesis methodology for distributed compliant mechanisms	MECHANICAL SCIENCES			English	Article								Synthesizing topologies of compliant mechanisms are based on rigid-link kinematic designs or completely automated optimization techniques. These designs yield mechanisms that match the kinematic specifications as a whole, but seldom yield user insight on how each constituent member contributes towards the overall mechanism performance. This paper reviews recent developments in building block based design of compliant mechanisms. A key aspect of such a methodology is formulating a representation of compliance at a (i) single unique point of interest in terms of geometric quantities such as ellipses and vectors, and (ii) relative compliance between distinct input(s) and output(s) in terms of load flow. This geometric representation provides a direct mapping between the mechanism geometry and their behavior, and is used to characterize simple deformable members that form a library of building blocks. The design space spanned by the building block library guides the decomposition of a given problem specification into tractable sub-problems that can be each solved from an entry in the library. The effectiveness of this geometric representation aids user insight in design, and enables discovery of trends and guidelines to obtain practical conceptual designs.

Credit card payment systems used in these transactions and operated by merchants are often targeted by hackers to steal the card data. To address this threat, the payment card industry establishes a mandatory security compliance standard for businesses that process credit cards. A central pre-requisite for this compliance procedure is to identify the credit card data flow, specifically, the stages of the card transaction processing and the server nodes that touch credit card data as they travel through the organization. In practice, this pre-requisite poses a challenge to merchants. As the payment infrastructure is implemented and later maintained, it often deviates from the original documented design. Without consistent tracking and auditing of changes, such deviations in many cases remain undocumented. Therefore building the credit card data flow for a given payment card processing infrastructure is considered a daunting task that at this point requires significant manual efforts. This paper describes a tool that is designed to automate the task of identifying the credit card data flow in commercial payment systems running on virtualized servers hosted in private cloud environments. This tool leverages virtual machine introspection technology to keep track of credit card data flows across multiple machines in real time without requiring intrusive instrumentation of the hypervisor, virtual machines, middleware or application source code. Effectiveness of this tool is demonstrated through its successful discovery of the credit card data flow of several open and closed source payment applications.

However, logistic problems are substantial. Automated systems solve many of these problems. We field-tested the feasibility and compliance that can be achieved using a computer touchscreen system in two consecutive studies. Patients and Methods: In study 1, a prospective cohort of 272 patients was offered QOL. assessment at each clinic appointment for 6 months. In study 2, all patients (N = 1,291) were offered QOL assessment as part of clinic routine during a 12-week period. Results: In study 1, 82% of patients agreed to take part, but over time, compliance was poor (median, 40%; mean, 43%) and deteriorated with longer follow-up. In study 2, the overall compliance was greatly increased (median, 100%; mean, 70%), and compliance was retained over multiple visits. In study 1, compliance was better in younger patients, males, and socially advantaged patients, but was not affected by the presence of depression or anxiety, or QOL. In the second study, building on experience in the first study, data collection and storage in the computer system was excellent, achieving 98% of collected data stored in one center. In general, patients were comfortable with the computers and the approach. Data collection on the wards was more difficult and less complete than in clinics, especially for patients undergoing acute admissions.

J	Awad, A; Gore, R; Hou, Z; Thomson, J; Weidlich, M				Awad, Ahmed; Gore, Rajeev; Hou, Zhe; Thomson, James; Weidlich, Matthias			An iterative approach to synthesize business process templates from compliance rules	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Process synthesis; Analysis of business process compliance specification; Process mining	TEMPORAL LOGIC; PROCESS MODELS; WORKFLOWS; DESIGN	Companies have to adhere to compliance requirements. The compliance analysis of business operations is typically a joint effort of business experts and compliance experts. Those experts need to create a common understanding of business processes to effectively conduct compliance management. In this paper, we present a technique that aims at supporting this process. We argue that process templates generated out of compliance requirements provide a basis for negotiation among business and compliance experts. We introduce a semi-automated and iterative approach to the synthesis of such process templates from compliance requirements expressed in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). We show how generic constraints related to business process execution are incorporated and present criteria that point at underspecification. Further, we outline how such underspecification may be resolved to iteratively build up a complete specification. For the synthesis, we leverage existing work on process mining and process restructuring. However, our approach is not limited to the control-flow perspective, but also considers direct and indirect data-flow dependencies. Finally, we elaborate on the application of the derived process templates and present an implementation of our approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The main possibilities of these systems are: control of the movement of materials, components and products within the production; construction the technological route and control over the accuracy of its compliance; identification all operations with a binding to the operators. Also authors are carried out the review of problems that can be solved by these systems. As one of the methods of identification of materials, components and products, the technology of using RFID-tags are considered. The main characteristics of RFID tags have analyzed (frequency of work, design, power supply). Advantages and disadvantages of this technology are revealed. For example, advantages are high protection at hard operating conditions, rewritable tags and the disadvantages are limited using the tags at high temperatures, occurrence the effect of collision. Authors made conclusions that investigated RFID-tags can be used for assembly manufacturing.

This requires trained staff and a lot of time. We propose to help speed up and facilitate the tedious task of coding patient information. Methods: we show two methods. First, we propose an automated ICD-10-based coding help system using an automated MeSH-based indexing system and a mapping between MeSH and ICD-10 extracted from the UMLS metathesaurus. Secondly, we propose the use of drug prescriptions to complete the previous coding with the use of a mapping between a given prescription drug and the relevant ICD-10 codes (in compliance with the drug approval). Results : the results of a preliminary experiment indicate that the precision of the indexing system is 40% and the recall is 30% when we compare to an economic rules-based coding and to a descriptive coding. Discussion: moreover, we show that the use of prescription coding is relevant as the recall reaches 68% when the Vidal tool is used. Conclusion : Then, it is very interesting to complete the coding obtained automatically by the indexing/mapping system by the coding obtained from the prescriptions.

Common Policy Language for Policy Compliance and Change Detection System in Managed Service in Data Networks	2014 INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON NETWORKS, COMPUTERS AND COMMUNICATIONS			English	Proceedings Paper	International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications	JUN 17-19, 2014	Hammamet, TUNISIA			Common Policy Language; Compliance and Real-time Change Detection; Policy Management		As networks continue to grow exponentially, the need to build, maintain, and troubleshoot the growing number of heterogeneous network components has also increased significantly. Often times, scheduled and ad-hoc configuration changes lead to potential configuration errors, policy violations, inefficiencies, and vulnerable states. The current network management landscape offers a variety of configuration auditing tools to reduce risks and achieve compliance. However; they mostly operate in an offline fashion and lack real time reporting capabilities. In our previous work, we proposed an Automated Policy Compliance and Change Detection System capable of audit configurations against internal policies or external best practices and provide centralized reporting for monitoring and regulatory purposes in real time. One of the core requirements for our proposed system is a common policy language for expressing device and organizational policies. This paper defines some of the building blocks of the proposed policy language. A common policy language that will ease the enforcement of policies to all components of the network. Furthermore, the proposed common policy language will bring numerous practical advantages, such as lowering implementation overhead, as well as the possibility to use the same or at least similar tools to maintain the policies.

However, any such exchange across networks to clients must be compliant to company standards so that uniformity and security in data dispensation is maintained. Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) solutions provide users with the flexibility of discharging information through network based protocols. This paper aims to build a compliance testing methodology for external vendors of an organisation who are interconnected with the OPC UA Server-Client Protocols. The structure is built on a host of UA clients that test UA specifications and information models from these vendors. This enables an organisational entity, for example, a manufacturer, to provide its clients, in this case external vendors such as suppliers, with the flexibility of conforming to prescribed standards in a testing phase on an automated digital platform rather than with older methods such as data transfer though databases or documents. An implementation of this approach is presented using example servers created for this purpose. It follows that external vendors can perform compliance testing and possibly improve their standards to match the company standards through remote testing after proper authentication measures provided by OPC UA.

AUTOMATED BURNED AREA DETECTION AND VIOLATION MONITORING USING LANDSAT-TM AND VHR DATA: AN ENGINEERING AND ECONOMIC STUDY TO ANALYSE LOCAL GOVERNANCE PERFORMANCE IN SARDINIA (ITALY)	2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS 2019)	IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing IGARSS		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)	JUL 28-AUG 02, 2019	Yokohama, JAPAN	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Inst Elect & Elect Engineers, Geoscience & Remote Sensing Soc		Landsat; Burned Area Monitoring; Illegal Land Development; Local Governance	SEVERITY; INDEX	This study aims at analysing local government efficiency using EO data to focus on the construction of new buildings in burned areas. We detected all forests and pastures of Sardinia (Sardinia) that witnessed at least a one-hectare wildfire, for biennium 2005-2006, using Landsat-TM data. We then monitored all the burned areas for a period of at least 10 years following the wildfire, up until 2016, by using Landsat products and VHR imagery provided by the Sardinian Region. The idea was to verify compliance with the Italian Framework Law on forest fires, which prohibits the construction of any structure or infrastructure aimed at civil settlements on woods and pastures affected by a fire for the next ten years. We retrieved as many as 748 burned areas, over which 148 violations were detected. These data have been used to carry out an econometric pilot analysis. Results suggest that, in general, the emergence of violations is inversely related to wildfire dimensions and that, on average, law-breaking occurs within the first five years.

In industrial CPS, distributed programmable logic controllers collaborate to control manufacturing plants. Design and analysis of such systems require a system model that covers control, computation, and communication with physical plant dynamics. This paper focuses on execution semantics for industrial CPS with the aim of providing a deterministic and platform-independent execution environment. A discrete-event-based execution semantics augmented with timestamp mechanism is proposed for IEC 61499 to provide deterministic behavior and guarantee compliance with real-time constraints for industrial CPS. The timestamped discrete-event-based execution semantics is implemented in an IEC 61499 runtime with service-enabled features. A case study of building automation system is used to prove the proposed semantics.

The construction of this gripper system is based on a linear pneumatic muscle used as the actuator and the transmission of motion by gear-and-rack mechanisms. Air compressibility renders pneumatic muscle behaviour inherently compliant; this favours automated assembly applications as it allows the correction of inevitable lateral and angular misalignments in mating operations. Therefore, the jamming of a peg-like object can be avoided when this is introduced into a hole with tight clearance. In addition to the construction of the gripper system, this paper discusses its actuation, as well other characteristics.

This requires surveyors to be more involved in the construction process. The resulting interactions between construction and measurement processes are described in the paper and modeled by high-level Petri nets. This type of modeling allows both an integration of a quality assurance as well as an efficiency analysis of the whole construction process with integrated measurement processes into the construction process. The specially developed planning tool is presented.

We define a policy as an expectation about some aspects of software quality that is expressed as a collection of non-functional requirements (NFRs), compliance to which can be potentially measured. The results of such measurements can be used to verify whether the product meets the expectation set about it. In this paper, we discuss existing NFR taxonomies and propose mapping of software metrics to twelve NFRs. We then propose a model for reliability prediction using publicly available quality metrics for several open source projects.

Furthermore, businesses still consider security and privacy related issues to be the most prominent inhibitors for an even more widespread adoption of cloud computing services. Several frameworks try to address these concerns by building comprehensive guidelines for security controls for the use of cloud services. However, assurance of the correct and effective implementation of such controls is required by businesses to attenuate the loss of control that is inherently associated with using cloud services. Giving this kind of assurance is traditionally the task of audits and certification. Cloud auditing becomes increasingly challenging for the auditor the more complex the cloud service provision chain becomes. There are many examples for Software as a Service (SaaS) providers that do not own dedicated hardware anymore for operating their services, but rely solely on other cloud providers of the lower layers, such as platform as a service (PaaS) or infrastructure as a service (IaaS) providers. The collection of data (evidence) for the assessment of policy compliance during a technical audit is aggravated the more complex the combination of cloud providers becomes. Nevertheless, the collection at all participating providers is required to assess policy compliance in the whole chain. The main contribution of this paper is an analysis of potential ways of collecting evidence in an automated way across cloud provider boundaries to facilitate cloud audits. Furthermore, a way of integrating the most suitable approaches in the system for automated evidence collection and auditing is proposed.

C	Jradi, M		Kurnitski, J; Kalamees, T		Jradi, Muhyiddine			The trade-off between deep energy retrofit and improving building intelligence in a university building	12TH NORDIC SYMPOSIUM ON BUILDING PHYSICS (NSB 2020)	E3S Web of Conferences		English	Proceedings Paper	12th Nordic Symposium on Building Physics (NSB)	SEP 06-09, 2020	Tallinn, ESTONIA				RENOVATION; DENMARK	In the last three decades, deep energy retrofit measures have been the standard option to improve the existing Danish building stock performance, with conventional techniques including envelope constructions insulation, windows change and lights replacement. While such techniques have demonstrated large technical and economic benefits, they may not be the optimal solution for every building retrofit case. With the advancement in the field of smart buildings and building automation systems, new energy performance improvement measures have emerged aiming to enhance the building intelligence quotient. In this paper, a technical evaluation and assessment of the trade-off between implementing deep energy retrofit techniques and improving building intelligence measures is provided. The assessment is driven by energy simulations of a detailed dynamic energy performance model developed in EnergyPlus. A 2500 m(2) university building in Denmark is considered as a case study, where a holistic energy model was developed and calibrated using actual data. Different performance improvement measures are implemented and assessed. Standard deep energy retrofit measures are considered, where the building intelligence improvement measures are in compliance with the European Standard EN 15232 recommendations. The overall assessment and evaluation results will serve as recommendations aiding the decision to retrofit the building and improve the performance.

Geometric validation of 3D city models based on standardized quality criteria	URBAN AND REGIONAL DATA MANAGEMENT			English	Proceedings Paper	Annual Symposium of the Urban-Data-Management-Society (UDMS)	MAY 29-31, 2013	London, ENGLAND	Urban Data Management Soc				High data quality of 3D city models is essential for modern applications. Although standards for quality of geospatial data have been published in the ISO 19100 series, there is no common understanding of quality for virtual city models. There are just too many different fields where 3D data can be exploited if compliance with data specifications is guaranteed. One example is the calculation of potential energy consumption for heating where closed solids are required to compute the building volumes. We describe a validation process for the geometry of city models. Modeling guidelines and recommendations were used to define exact specifications for a new city model. After creation of the model the compliance with these specifications is validated. Violations of the rules are detected and documented in a quality report. The validation process is automated and can be customized. Results of the validation process are analyzed with the target to improve the validation tool.

However, dynamic modelling of PMAs, which is important to control performance, has not been researched extensively. Hence, a testing device was designed and built to investigate PMA's dynamics. The device automates the experimental process by providing motions and recording pressure, force, position and velocity data. The gathered experimental data enable the authors to validate a previous PMA dynamic model. Meanwhile, new models are developed from the original model. Statistical analysis proves that the new models can better represent the PMA dynamics during the experiments.

This study proposes a design of integral reminder systems that automates the process of appointment rescheduling for patients and physicians in addition to confirmation and cancellation. Based on the premises of patient-centered care of media synchronicity theory, design principles are proposed to cater to the different requirements of healthcare providers and patient users on appointment management. The design provides useful guidelines for building integral reminder systems that enhance medical compliance.

J	Lee, H; Lee, JK; Park, S; Kim, I				Lee, Hyunsoo; Lee, Jin-Kook; Park, Seokyung; Kim, Inhan			Translating building legislation into a computer-executable format for evaluating building permit requirements	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building information modeling (BIM); Automated design assessment; Rule checking; Logic rule; Computer-executable form		In this paper, we describe an approach to translating the written content of the Korean Building Act into a computer-executable format for the purpose of evaluating building permit requirements. Among the various applications of building information modeling (BIM), we focus on automated design assessment and its rule making process, which has been performed by both architects and software developers. Compared to the conventional rule-making approach, which is integrated with rule-checking software, our suggested mechanism (KBimLogic) of converting rule sentences from the Korean Building Act into computer-executable code (KBimCode) is a software-independent approach that separates the rule-making and rule-checking processes. We use the rule-making approach to translate the Korean Building Act into an explicit code that focuses on building permit requirements. Building permit-related regulations are defined in the Korean Building Act, but some of the sentences are ambiguous, and some implicit definitions hinder translation into an explicitly defined computer-executable form. Some building permit-related requirements vary by building type, administrative district, permitted date, and as-built date; thus, it is critical to design computable rules independent of specific proprietary software. The building permit system in Korea changes (as it does in other countries), making it critical that code compliance rules be kept up-to-date. Our work is motivated by such fundamentals and suggests a logic rule-based mechanism for use by non-programmers and a user-friendly approach to the rule-making process. The scope and major components of our research are as follows: (1) noun phrases classify building objects and associated properties from the Korean Building Act; (2) verb phrases derive high-level methods to construct the actual rule-checking body; and (3) the logic rule-based mechanism processes natural language sentences. In the actual implementation for translation, this approach has been demonstrated by each database and a GUI-based application named KBimLogic, for generating KBimCode. The KBimCode, which contains a set of specific building permit requirements translated from sentences, can be imported into our code-checking software (KBimAssess) using a specific file format.

It is possible to minimize the damages and loses caused by fires with precautions. In this article, fire safety precautions were analyzed with two different methods on the selected hospital project. In the first applied method in the analysis, control table which created by traditional methods is used. In the second one, Fire Regulations Control Automation (YYKO) model was developed to test compliance to the National Fire Regulations (BYKHY) both in the design phase, and the existing buildings. Fire Regulations Control Automation (YYKO) model was developed by using Visual Studio Net programming platform and Visual Basic Net programming language. Sample project National Fire Regulations (BYKHY) accordance has been investigated with this mentioned model. At the end of the study, it has been seen that the sample hospital project does not exactly fulfill the provision of National Fire Legislation (BYKHY)	[Demirel, Fusun] Gazi Univ, Mimarlik Fak, Mimarlik Bol, Ankara, Turkey; [Basdemir, Huseyin] Gaziosmanpasa Univ, Muh & Doga Bil Fak, Insaat Muh Bol, Tasliciftlik Tokat, Turkey; [Iseri, Ismail] Ondokuz Mayis Univ, Bilgisayar Muh Bol, Muh Fak, Samsun, Turkey	Demirel, F (corresponding author), Gazi Univ, Mimarlik Fak, Mimarlik Bol, Celal Bayar Bulvari, Ankara, Turkey.	fusund@gazi.edu.tr; huseyin.basdemir@gop.edu.tr; iseriismail@gmail.com					[Anonymous], 2000, BOCA NAT BUILD COD U; [Anonymous], 2005, STAND HLTH CAR FAC N; [Anonymous], 2009, RESMI GAZETE; [Anonymous], 2007, LIF SAF COD NEPA 101; Basdemir H., 2010, THESIS GAZI U; Basdemir H, 2010, J POLYTECH, V13, P101, DOI 10.2339/2010.13.2,101-109; Demirel F, 2009, TUYAK YANG GUV S IST, P65; Demirel F., 2010, 1002 TUBITAK; Demirel F., 2003, J FACULTY ENG ARCHIT, V18, P89; Demirel F., 2006, J FACULTY ENG ARCHIT, V21, P39; Demirel F, 2005, J POLYTECH, V8, P381; Demirel F, 2010, J POLYTECH, V13, P65, DOI 10.2339/2010.13.1.65-70; Draft Guide To Fire Precautions In Hospitals Publisher, 1982, GUID FIR PR IN PRESS; Kilic A., 2010, YANGIN GUVENLIK DERG, V127, P8	14	3	3	0	2	GAZI UNIV, FAC ENGINEERING ARCHITECTURE	ANKARA	BAYAR BULVARI, MALTEPE, ANKARA, 06570, TURKEY	1300-1884			J FAC ENG ARCHIT GAZ	J.

This practice is not going to disappear, at least in the foreseeable future. Most enterprises need personal information to run their businesses and provide the required services, many of whom have turned to identity management solutions to do this in an efficient and automated way. Privacy laws dictate how enterprises should handle personal data in a privacy compliant way: this requires dealing with privacy rights, permissions and obligations. It involves operational and compliance aspects. Currently much is done by means of manual processes, which make them difficult and expensive to comply with. A key requirement for enterprises is being able to leverage their investments in identity management solutions. This paper focuses on how to automate the enforcement of privacy within enterprises in a systemic way, in particular privacy-aware access to personal data and enforcement of privacy obligations: this is still open to innovation. We introduce our work in these areas: core concepts are described along with our policy enforcement models and related technologies. Two prototypes have been built as a proof of concept and integrated with state-of-the-art (commercial) identity management solutions to demonstrate the feasibility of our work. We provide technical details, discuss open issues and our next steps.

Development cycles must become faster to deliver critical updates in shorter time. Simultaneously, software takes over more and more safety-critical tasks, requiring strict software development processes. Up to today, these processes suffer from extensive manual review work and written, static documentation in form of standards, checklists, and procedures. This paper presents a monolithic, process-oriented build tool for model-based development in MATLAB, Simulink, and Stateflow. Beyond classical build automation functionality, it supports and accelerates process workflows. The tool provides infrastructure to formalize and ship workflows, checklists, and standards, but also features to assess completeness, consistency, compliance, and cleanliness with respect to them. Additionally, it allows definition of dynamic, incrementally updated checklists, and composes traceability in parallel with the build. The efficacy and achievable process coverage is demonstrated in an example application.

The gripper's main features are high flexibility regarding shape, size and material of the units handled. Furthermore adhesive gripping provides a very accurate centring effect as well as a compliance effect. The adhesive used for gripping is a fluid of low viscosity, that evaporates without leaving particles on the unit's surface which influence the function. The surface tension of the fluid attracts the unit to the gripper and builds up forces that can hold micromechanical parts very safely without damaging the breakable surface structures of these parts. The automated adhesive gripping-system can be integrated as a standard tool in handling systems such as for MEMS, for microelectronical devices or for precision engineering products. Theoretical examinations and experimental results concerning process parameters, lifting forces and tolerances of the parts position are presented. Besides the automatic gripper two different manual adhesive grippers have been built and investigated.

In theory, by using log-files and process mining tools, auditors can automate the auditing process instead of data gathering and taking samples. However, audits are rarely supported by process mining tools in practice. This paper investigates the reasons for that. We identified the fact that the published audit frameworks with process mining are not oriented on real auditors. They replace the auditors with compliance experts and do not see the necessary steps of refinement of audit statements to make them useful both for writing process mining filters and for analysis of the process instances on correspondence to audit goals and policies. We also identified that the building or correcting business process models for audit is often driven by the log information. On the basis of our findings, we propose an extension of the audit frameworks with process mining and evaluate our extension by conducting case studies of audit in different business domains.

Together with other national and international regulations and laws as well as client specific requirements, long lists of banned substances have to be managed, controlled and fulfilled by the Supplier Industry. Therefore, automated organisational security between business partners and between company departments become essential. In order to reduce process costs, the handling of compliance data has to be transferred from island solutions into company's main business solution. Data about "not-to-use-substances" are required where product decisions are made daily, i.e. in Laboratory, Purchase and Engineering department but also in Production and Controlling/Finance. The centralised availability of data within companies combined with effective tools to link supplier data as well as customer requirements together is a main challenge for IT tools today. Based on SAP's business suite, the following text provides a solution map to meet today's business requirements in the area of compliance, environment and safety.

It focuses on RFPs for large public buildings (over 5 million dollars) in South Korea, which generally entail complex designs. A total of 27 RFPs for housing, office, exhibition, hospital, sports center, and courthouse projects were analyzed to develop computer-interpreted RFP rules. Each RFP was composed of over 1800 sentences. Of these, only three to 366 sentences could be translated into a computer-interpretable sentence. For further analysis, this study deployed context-free grammar (CFG) in natural language processing, and classified morphemes into four categories: i.e., object (noun), method (verb), strictness (modal), and others. The subcategorized morphemes included three types of objects, twenty-nine types of methods, and five levels of strictness. The coverage applicability of the derived objects and methods was checked and validated against three additional RFP cases and then through a test case using a newly developed model checker system. The findings are expected to be useful as a guideline and basic data for system developers in the development of a generalized automated design checking system for South Korea. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The relevance of the work consists in the development of computer-aided design methods for automatic real-time logic control devices by developing a single template in a synthesized subset of the hardware description language in the style of automata-based programming with implementation on the PLD hardware platform (FPGA, CPLD). Development of the description template for timed control finite state machines (FSM) in the hardware description language VHDL, automated synthesis and implementation of the model in PLD (FPGAs, CPLDs) using Xilinx ISE, subsequent analysis of the received circuit implementation for compliance with values of timing parameters of the circuit after implementation. Objective. The aim of the work is to develop principles for constructing models of timed control FSM in the VHDL hardware description language. In this work, we solved the problem of constructing a pattern for describing models of timed control Moore FSM using VHDL, automated synthesis and implementation of the obtained VHDL model in PLDs (FPGA, CPLD) using Xilinx ISE and subsequent analysis of the resulting circuit implementation for compliance with values of timing parameters of the circuit after implementation. Method. Realization of models' parameters of timed FSM in logical control systems using VHDL statements. Development of VHDL language constructions of timed FSM models for timing parameters implementation that provide the correct automated synthesis and implementation of these models in PLDs (FPGA, CPLD) using CAD tools Xilinx ISE. Results. Synthesis and implementation of proposed templates of VHDL-models of timed control Moore FSM in logic control systems by XILINX ISE CAD tools confirmed the receipt of not redundant circuits in PLD (FPGA, CPLD), and simulation after implementation showed the efficiency of such models. Conclusions. The work solves the problem of computer-aided design of timed control FSM in real-time logic control systems. To solve this problem, VHDL-models of timed control Moore FSM were developed, which made it possible to implement control FSM with time constraints, timeouts and output delays. Automated synthesis and simulation of VHDL models based on the developed templates confirmed the efficiency and correctness of the proposed models. The scientific novelty of the work consists in the further development of methods for constructing templates of HDL models of timed control Moore FSM, which made it possible to implement control FSM with time constraints, timeouts and output delays, as well as perform their correct automated synthesis and simulation. The practical value of results is in the development of procedures for constructing VHDL models of timed Moore control FSM in real-time logic control systems, which made it possible to automate the synthesis of control FSM taking into account the possibility of processing external events and implementing arbitrary delays for output signals and to increase the flexibility and speed of designed systems. The developed procedures can be useful for designers of timed control FSM in Xilinx ISE.	[Miroshnyk, M.

The focus now is to exploit the cloud for innovation, utilizing the agility to expand resources to quickly build out new designs, products, simulations and analysis. As the cloud lowers the unit cost of IT and improves agility, the time to market for applications will improve significantly. Companies will use this agility and speed as competitive advantage. An example of the agility is the adoption by enterprises of the software-defined datacenter (SDDC)[3] model, which allows for the rapid build of environments with composable infrastructures. With adoption of the SDDC model, intelligent and automated management of the SDDC is an immediate priority, required to support the changing workloads and dynamic patterns of the enterprise. Often, security and compliance become an 'after thought', bolted on later when problems arise. In this paper, we will discuss our experience in developing and deploying a centralized management system for public, as well as an Openstack [4] based cloud platform in SoftLayer, with an innovative, analytics-driven 'security compliance as a service' that constantly adjusts to varying compliance requirements based on workload, security and compliance requirements. In this paper we will also focus on techniques we have developed for capturing and replaying the previous state of a failing client virtual machine (VM) image, roll back, and then re-execute to analyze failures related to security or compliance. This technique contributes to agility, since failing VM's with security issues can quickly be analyzed and brought back online; this is often not the case with security problems, where analysis and forensics can take several days/weeks.

Automated Speed Photo Enforcement Effects on Speeds in Work Zones	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							RADAR	Automated speed enforcement in construction zones has the potential to increase compliance with the speed limit and improve safety. The effectiveness of speed photo enforcement (SPE) (by radar) in reducing speeds and increasing speed limit compliance in work zones was evaluated for the first time in the United States, at Illinois work zones. Details are presented on SPE implementation and its effectiveness at the point it was stationed and at a downstream location in a work zone. Speed data were collected at the location of SPE and at a location 1.5 mi downstream in the work zone to determine the point and spatial effects of SPE. Speeds were measured for free-flowing and platooned cars and heavy vehicles in shoulder and median lanes. Results showed that SPE is effective in reducing the average speed and increasing compliance with work zone speed limit. The SPE reduced speed in the median lane more than in the shoulder lane, as expected. In addition, the speed of free-flowing vehicles was reduced more than for platooned vehicles. The reduction of the mean speed varied from 3.2 to 7.3 mph. The percentage of vehicles exceeding the speed limit near SPE was reduced from about 40% to 8% for free-flowing cars and from 17% to 4% for free-flowing heavy vehicles. Near the SPE van, none of the cars exceeded the speed limit by more than 10 mph, and none of the heavy vehicles exceeded it by more than 5 mph. The data also showed a mixed spatial effect for SPE. At the downstream location, the speed reduction for cars was not significant, while it varied from 0.9 to 2.5 mph for heavy vehicles.

Enterprise mash-ups facilitate end users' development of applications in a business context autonomously or with minimal support from the software engineering staff. Hence, mashup solutions are aimed at exploiting the full potential of end users' software development. However, the use of mashup solutions for business tasks gives rise to several security and privacy-related questions, since sensitive data records could be created even with simple procedures. In this paper, we propose an approach where security rules for mashup compositions can be defined, and submitted mashups are automatically evaluated for compliance with the respective policies.

As we look to new technologies to solve existing problems, we can consider Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a tool to make construction safer and efficient. Through this paper, we explore the ways in which AI can assist in the goal of making construction sites safe. This study proposes the development of an AI platform, which improves construction safety through hazard identification at the pre-construction stage, and suggests the applicable OSHA codes for the identified hazards, thus allowing safety standards to be implemented for compliance. Emphasis is laid on the mitigation of fall hazards, which is the leading cause of accidents in construction. Currently, project safety and risk assessment in the construction industry is carried out by professionals, who heavily rely on their own experiences and knowledge on decision making. There is a lack of a systematic approach and the ways to check the reliability of these decisions. Through the machine learning aspect of AI, we can automate the process and create an environment where potential hazards are identified before they occur with a link to the OSHA standards for recommended mitigation strategies.

The developed system is capable of displaying greenhouse and irrigation scheduling parameters. Irrigation can wirelessly be automated by the sensor node by activating irrigation based on sensor values and predefined irrigation parameters. A low power sensor node was developed to record greenhouse conditions, measuring soil moisture, light, CO2, temperature, and humidity. The sensor node wirelessly sends all measured data to a graphical user interface application running on a server. All data received by the GUI is stored within a MySQL database for history and statistical purposes. An irrigation module was also designed, enabling the system to wirelessly actuate irrigation when required. Irrigation can either be manually operated through the GUI, or automated through the sensor node based on current greenhouse conditions. The system's wireless communication is implemented using ZigBee modules and the modules have been configured with Digi-Mesh firmware, enabling mesh network functionality on all wireless devices. The ISS is low cost and energy efficient.	[Jooste, F.

J	Dawood, H; Siddle, J; Dawood, N				Dawood, Huda; Siddle, Jonathan; Dawood, Nashwan			INTEGRATING IFC AND NLP FOR AUTOMATING CHANGE REQUEST VALIDATIONS	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						3D models; IFC; NLP; AI; Web Services for construction	CODE COMPLIANCE CHECKING; BIM; MANAGEMENT; MODEL	The management and the identification of design changes constitute an essential part of the of a design flow within the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, requiring the formalisation of a multi-disciplinary collaborative information modelling environment. Construction projects generate substantial amount of change information, which needs to be updated continuously throughout the process, from initial feasibility study to the decommissioning of facilities. Complications arise from the information storage in multiple incompatible file formats that can lead to the loss or omission of details. In addition to any unexpected changes, the mismanagement of information is another factor leading to delays and costly errors. In order to mitigate such issues, this paper proposes to integrate the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data model and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to validate and visually identify the result of change requests. The system is developed using C# by 1) integrating angular framework with ASP.NET (Active Server Pages) to create a dynamic single web page and 2). Using X-BIM toolkit that supports IFC format to read, create and visualise the BuildingSmart Data Models (aka IFC Models). This approach enables a web-based platform capable of generating reports and visual previews, highlighting the differences between IFC files throughout the design processes. A web-based system prototype allows users to compare subsequent versions of IFC design models in terms of additions, modifications and deletions. The prototype uses NLP to intelligently identify the changes that have been made as it compares newer and older versions of the same model, making this information available to designers and 3D modellers. Prospective work will focus on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to automate the implementation of changes within the construction models.

Semi-automated Time-Granularity Detection for Data-Driven Simulation Using Process Mining and System Dynamics	CONCEPTUAL MODELING, ER 2020	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	39th International Conference on Conceptual Modeling (ER)	NOV 03-06, 2020	Vienna, AUSTRIA			Process mining; Scenario-based predictions; System dynamics; What-if analysis; Simulation; Time-series analysis		Most information systems supporting operational processes also record event logs. These can be used to diagnose performance and compliance problems. The majority of process mining techniques extract models that are descriptive and describe what happened in the past. Few process mining techniques discover models that allow us to "look into the future" and perform predictive analyses. Recently, novel approaches have been developed for scenario-based prediction, i.e., predicting the effects of process changes on process performance, e.g., investing in an additional resource. To work accurately, the techniques need an appropriate time step-size, the selection of which, thus far, has been an ad-hoc and manual endeavor. Therefore, in this paper, building upon time-series analysis and forecasting techniques, we propose a novel semi-automated time-granularity detection framework. Our framework detects the best possible time-granularity to be used, whilst taking user preferences into account. Our evaluation, using both real and synthetic data, confirms the feasibility of our approach and highlights the importance of using accurate granularity in time step selection.

We conduct a mixed-design user study with multiple robots to investigate trust, inappropriate reliance, and compliance measures in the context of a time-constrained game. We also examine how the effect of human accountability addresses errors due to over-compliance in the context of human robot interaction (HRI). This study is novel as it involves examining multiple attributes at once, thus enabling us to perform multi-way comparisons between different attributes on trust and compliance with the agent. Results from the 4x4x2x2 study show that behavior and anthropomorphism of the agent are the most significant factors in predicting the trust and compliance with the robot. Furthermore, adding a coalition-building preface, where the agent provides context to why it might make errors while giving advice, leads to an increase in trust for specific behaviors of the agent.

An increasing body of work is reporting the derivation of lineage-specific progenitors from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which could in the near future be used to engineer personalized tissue substitutes, including those for reconstructive therapies of bone. Although the potential clinical impact of such technology is not arguable, significant challenges remain to be addressed before hiPSC-derived progenitors can be employed to engineer bone substitutes of clinical relevance. The most important challenge is indeed the construction of personalized multicellular bone substitutes for the treatment of complex skeletal defects that integrate fast, are immune tolerated and display biofunctionality and long-term safety. As recent studies suggest, the merging of iPSC technology with advanced biomaterials and bioreactor technologies offers a way to generate bone substitutes in a controllable, automated manner with potential to meet the needs for scale-up and requirements for translation into clinical practice. It is only via the use of state-of-the-art cell culture technologies, process automation under GMP-compliant conditions, application of appropriate engineering strategies and compliance with regulatory policies that personalized lab-made bone grafts can start being used to treat human patients.

Owners and contractors are continuously working on reducing the unusually high rate of injuries and fatalities in the construction industry. Research has shown that injury reduction is only possible by improving the way safety is managed on site. Currently, managing project safety is a reactive process that is the sole responsibility of the safety manager. The safety manager's main objective is to ensure the contractor's compliance with OSHA regulations. This usually involves spending long hours sifting through volumes of safety regulations to determine what apply to a given project. To improve safety management, a more proactive approach that integrates safety with other project management functions is needed. Such approach would involve more people in the safety management process, would ensure timely availability of safety information and would utilize safety knowledge in design and in the selection of construction methods. For this proactive approach to be effective, computer based systems: that effectively manage safety information are needed. Some computer-based systems have been developed to support the safety management process. The paper initially presents a discussion of these systems to illustrate their limitations. The paper then proposes an integrated knowledge-based database management system for automating safety management. The proposed system integrates safety and schedule information thereby making safety a more integral part of the overall project planning and control cycle. The proposed system ensures timely access to safety information by associating each schedule activity with required safety actions. Such association is automatically performed by the knowledge base after the user responds to questions related to the specific job conditions and the equipment utilized. Output from the system consists of daily reports that list safety actions to be performed on a given day.

J	Ren, R; Zhang, JS				Ren, Ran; Zhang, Jiansong			Semantic Rule-Based Construction Procedural Information Extraction to Guide Jobsite Sensing and Monitoring	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article							SYSTEM	Existing construction monitoring systems rely on designated personnel to compare a planned procedure in the instructional documents with an execution procedure on the jobsite. It requires major human efforts and is time-consuming, costly, and human error-prone. To reduce manual efforts in collecting information from construction procedural documents, selecting appropriate sensing techniques to collect data on the jobsite, and giving in-time feedback for progress monitoring and compliance checking, the authors: (1) proposed a semantic rule-based information extraction (IE) method to extract construction execution steps from construction procedural documents automatically; (2) developed a construction procedure and data collection (CPDC) ontology to classify construction site information and provide guidance on selecting sensing techniques for collecting jobsite data based on the extracted information; and (3) proposed a construction procedural data integration (CPDI) framework, which could integrate textual data and sensing data to conduct construction execution steps compliance checking automatically. The proposed IE method offers a novel way to retrieve construction activities (e.g., install door and prepare surface) from the construction procedural documents that are an important source of information but were seldom analyzed in previous research. It focuses on extracting construction execution steps, which supports the incorporation of execution sequence information into construction jobsite management. A novel information classification application based on a newly developed CPDC ontology is provided to support IE. The IE results provide a new instrument for selecting sensing techniques based on different construction site data categories. The proposed method is developed to support a targeted unified CPDI framework that integrates the following: natural language processing (NLP) and sensing techniques to automatically extract, analyze, and process both planned procedures from textual data from construction procedural documents and executed procedures from sensing data of construction jobsites. It also can be extended to any domain applications that contain textual information and site activity information that needs to be matched or compared. In this paper, the authors focus on the NLP-based textual information extraction of the construction procedural documents, introduced the detailed steps involved, and proposed a CPDI framework on top of and as an application of the IE method. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the IE method with a set of open-source specifications. Comparing it to a manually developed gold standard, 97.08% precision and 93.23% recall were achieved using the proposed IE method for the extraction of construction execution steps. A qualitative analysis on sensing technique selection based on the IE results was also performed. The proposed IE method can be applied to the automation of construction site management tasks (e.g., construction monitoring) that integrates both textual information and sensing data to support construction decision-makings. It enables the transformation of construction monitoring/control from a human-intensive process to an automated one. (C) 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

A construction worker has a chance of 1-in-200 of dying on the job during a 45-year career, mainly due to fires, falls, and being struck or caught-in/between objects. This in part can be attributed to how monitoring the presence and proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by safety officers becomes inefficient when surveying large areas and a considerable number of workers. Therefore, this paper takes the initial steps and aims at evaluating existing computer vision techniques, namely object detection methods, in rapidly detecting whether workers are wearing hardhats from images captured on many indoor jobsites. Experiments have been conducted and results highlighted the potential of cascade classifiers, in particular, in accurately and precisely detecting hardhats under various scenarios and for repetitive runs.

Carbon credit trading, one of these programs, has been used in many countries to comply with the protocol. In spite of the existence of carbon credit markets for over a decade, global GHG emissions recently reached their highest recorded level ever. The credits clearly have not achieved their promised results. Buildings have likewise hardly been affected, even though their energy use is among the largest sources of emissions. There is great potential for the construction sector to employ blockchain to support a significant reduction in fossil fuel consumption and improve building energy performance. In an attempt to revamp carbon credit trading, several non-profit foundations recently unveiled a blockchain trading scheme that is applicable to the carbon credit market. Financial activity which utilizes interconnected data "blocks" has many advantages. For example, this technology eliminates the need for time-consuming security to protect transactions. This goal of this paper is to present a new carbon trading paradigm that employs blockchain technology and that the construction industry can utilize to incentivize participation in the carbon market. This "smart" automation can simplify regulatory compliance.

Because PHCS members are typically produced by the extrusion method in longline precast plants, it is extremely difficult to provide shear reinforcements due to the automated fabrication method for forming multiple hollow-cores in a cross section. However, the current ACI 318 building code stipulates that the web-shear capacity ofhollowcore members over 315 mm (12.5 in.) thickness without minimum shear reinforcement should be reduced by half, which increases the demands of shear strengthening for a thick PHCS member at its end regions. In this study, the shear tests of thick PHCS members strengthened in shear; using various core filling methods frequently used in the current precast industry, were conducted and a new analytical method was addressed to estimate the shear strengths of the PHCS members composite with core-filling concretes.

It presents an approach that shows good potential to address security, risk and compliance issues the bank has in its daily business by the use of integrated organizational models build up by enterprise modeling activities. Such organizational models are intended to serve to describe, evaluate, automate, monitor and control as well as to develop an organization respecting given organizational security, risk and compliance side-constraints. Based on the empirical scenario at Credit Suisse, real-world requirements towards a modeling framework as well as the modeling process are developed. Graph Transformation techniques are proposed as formal framework for this purpose and they are evaluated in the sense of how far they can support the identified enterprise modeling activities in the context of the new enterprise modeling framework.

On-time delivery of a customers order not only builds trust in the business organization but is also cost effective. Therefore, there is a need is to monitor complex business processes though automated systems which should be capable during execution to predict delay in processes so as to provide a better customer experience. This online problem has led us to develop an automated solution using machine learning algorithms so as to predict possible delay in business processes. The core characteristic of the proposed system is the extraction of generic process event log, graphical and sequence features, using the log generated by the process as it executes up to a given point in time where a prediction need to be made (referred to here as cut-off time); in an executing process this would generally be current time. These generic features are then used with Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Decision trees to predict the data into on-time or delayed processes. The experimental results are presented based on real business processes evaluated using various metric performance measures such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F-measure and AUC for prediction as to whether the order will complete on-time when it has already been executing for a given period.

J	Providenti, M; Zai, R				Providenti, Michael; Zai, Robert, II			Web accessibility at Kentucky's academic libraries	LIBRARY HI TECH			English	Article						worldwide web; academic libraries; United States of America		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide an update on the implementation of web accessibility guidelines at Kentucky academic library web sites. Design/methodology/approach - The academic library home pages of Bachelor-degree granting institutions of Kentucky were tested for accessibility compliance using an online automated program. In addition, a series of manual accessibility tests were performed. Data were collected on errors against accessibility guidelines for each site. Data collected in 2003 were compared to data collected in 2007. Findings - The number of library home pages complying with basic accessibility guidelines is increasing. However, most sites that score well are built to comply with checkpoints that can be tested automatically. Few institutions included accessibility features which required manual verification. Research limitations/implications - This study relies largely on data collected with an imperfect accessibility-checking software program. Some accessibility checkpoints can appear to be satisfied using automated accessibility tests despite the presence of accessibility barrier beings. Also, minor errors against accessibility guidelines are not distinguished from major accessibility barriers. Practical implications - This study provides an impetus for web developers to aim higher than the automated accessibility checkpoints. It demonstrates a limited number of manual accessibility checkpoints that can be objectively tested. Originality/value - This paper looks beyond accessibility guidelines that can be tested automatically to see if accessibility guidelines for which manual tests must be performed are being implemented.

Retrofit control solutions for old buildings using WSN.	2015 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER, COMMUNICATIONS, AND CONTROL TECHNOLOGY (I4CT)			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Computer Communications Control Technology	APR 21-23, 2015	Kuching, MALAYSIA	Malayasia Tech Sci Assoc, Univ Malayasia Pahang, Univ Malayasia Perlis, IEEE Malayasia Sect, CN		WSN; ZigBee; HVAC; control; automation; thermal comfort; indoor air quality; blinds; window; smart buildings; retrofit		Sustainability of old buildings is constantly challenged due to its non-compliance with energy saving practices. Old buildings which aim to deploy technologies to improve thermal comfort face some infrastructure constraints. The sustainability of such buildings is dependent on occupant's thermal comfort, low carbon emissions and reduced energy consumption. Such buildings face restraints in the way in which wired and wireless technologies could be used to implement sensing and control actions. Constraints include infrastructure limitations and space usage restrictions. This paper discusses retrofit solutions for old buildings for minimizing energy consumption and maximizing the occupant's comfort. The implementation of the retrofitted solution in an existing old building with minimal infrastructure change is elaborated. This includes implementation of thermal comfort based algorithm for zonal damper control, indoor air quality based window control and light sensor based blinds control. The sensing and control action is based on indigenous circuits communicating through ZigBee wireless protocol in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) of motes. A WingZ gateway runs the thermal comfort algorithm and acts as command centre for the WSN. The research aims to demonstrate the possibility of extending sustainability of existing old buildings by using energy conscious building automation solutions where large scale infrastructure change is not possible.

With the advent of databases and automation to both capture LOD requirements based on particular use cases and automatic validation of LOD compliance prior to performing use cases, the full power of object based LOD is becoming apparent. Within this new LOD framework, design progress reporting, quality metrics reporting, and design gate control is possible at a BIM object level. With the growing value to customers of BIM models as complete life cycle tools, and the increasing use of digital devices during construction, such as tablets, to view building information, could the end of the drawing sheet paradigm be at hand?

Occupants make equipment purchasing decisions; generate heat, moisture, and contaminants; adjust operable windows, window blinds, thermostats, electric lighting; and, use appliances. Their behaviors may result in a difference in energy use by a factor of two or more. 1 Even in buildings with a high degree of automation, occupants may use buildings in ways never conceived of by the designer, or complain to the operator at the possible cost of a permanent and energy-intensive override on building controls.(2)	[O'Brien, William; Gilani, Sara; Ouf, Mohamed] Carleton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Human Bldg Interact Lab, Ottawa, ON, Canada	O'Brien, W (corresponding author), Carleton Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Human Bldg Interact Lab, Ottawa, ON, Canada.

BIM data interoperability issues, including lack of a clear understanding of owner's exchange requirements (ERs), inconsistent syntax in developing discipline-specific models, and software limitations contribute to the difficulty of using architecture, engineering, and construction-purposed BIMs for FM handover. This research explores a case-based example of implementing computational BIM for automatic verification of an FM-handover BIM at project close out. The relationships between, and properties of, model objects used to capture the required geometric and non-geometric information for the owner's needs at project close out are specified in accordance with the applicable IFC concepts. The terminologies and taxonomies are formalized in conjunction with the buildingSMART Data Dictionary (bsDD) schema. Dynamo is used as a visual programming platform to work with the Autodesk Revit application programming interface (API) to extend its parametric capabilities for automatic verification of BIM data in compliance with the specified requirements. The results of the automated verification procedure highlight completeness, uniqueness, correctness, usefulness, and unambiguity of BIM data as critical quality dimensions for the purpose of project delivery.

J	Bosche, F; Guenet, E				Bosche, Frederic; Guenet, Emeline			Automating surface flatness control using terrestrial laser scanning and building information models	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Laser scanning; BIM; Quality control; Surface; Slab; Flatness; Regularity	CONSTRUCTION; OBJECTS; SCANS	Current practice in the control of surface flatness requires a significant amount of time and labor, and delivers results based on few sample measurements. Developments of Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and Building Information Modeling (BIM) offer great opportunities to achieve a leap forward in the efficiency and completeness of dimensional control operations. This paper presents an approach that demonstrates the value of this integration for surface flatness control. The approach employs the Scan-vs-BIM principle of Bosche and Haas (2008) to segment TLS point clouds acquired on-site, by matching each point to the corresponding object in the BIM model. The novel approach then automatically applies two different standard flatness control techniques, Straightedge and F-Numbers, to the TLS points associated to each floor, and concludes with regard to their compliance with given tolerances. The approach is tested and validated using data from two actual concrete slabs. Results confirm the suitability of using TLS for conducting standard dimensional controls, and validate the performance of our system when compared to traditional measurement methods (in terms of both quality and efficiency). Furthermore, a novel straightedge generation method is proposed and demonstrated that enables more complete and homogeneous analysis of floor flatness for insignificant additional processing times.

This control algorithm requires dynamic modeling of the hanging object to estimate the amount of the shock. The dynamic model mimics the steel beam suspended by the crane and the robot to grip the beam in 3-dimesional space. Under limited impact, the manipulator grips the object with pre-acting control that can increase the duration of the impact time. In this paper, assuming that location information is provided by a vision system dynamic simulations are presented, which is very similar to the actual steel beam assembly in building construction environment. The goal of this paper is to evaluate how force, vibration, and stabilization time exerted on the entire robot arm system change before and after applying 'pre-acting control algorithm' through the simulations. Also, based on the simulation results, it was concluded that this pre-acting control algorithm can be efficiently applied to real construction sites as well as other industrial sites in the future.

Existing software systems consist of heterogeneous components emitting logs in various formats. A typical solution is to unify the logs using manually built parsers, which is laborious. Instead, we explore the possibility of automating the parsing task by employing machine translation (MT). We create a tool that generates synthetic Apache log records which we used to train recurrent-neural-network-based MT models. Models' evaluation on real-world logs shows that the models can learn Apache log format and parse individual log records. The median relative edit distance between an actual real-world log record and the MT prediction is less than or equal to 28%. Thus, we show that log parsing using an MT approach is promising.

J	Song, J; Lee, JK; Choi, J; Kim, I				Song, Jaeyeol; Lee, Jin-Kook; Choi, Jungsik; Kim, Inhan			Deep learning-based extraction of predicate-argument structure (PAS) in building design rule sentences	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL DESIGN AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						automated rule checking; building information modeling (BIM); natural language processing (NLP); predicate argument structure	CHECKING; BIM; SYSTEM	This paper describes an approach to extracting a predicate-argument structure (PAS) in building design rule sentences using natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning models. For the computer to reason about the compliance of building design, design rules represented by natural language must be converted into a computer-readable format. The rule interpretation and translation processes are challenging tasks because of the vagueness and ambiguity of natural language. Many studies have proposed approaches to address this problem, but most of these are dependent on manual tasks, which is the bottleneck to expanding the scope of design rule checking to design requirements from various documents. In this paper, we apply deep learning-based NLP techniques for translating design rule sentences into a computer-readable data structure. To apply deep learning-based NLP techniques to the rule interpretation process, we identified the semantic role elements of building design requirements and defined a PAS for design rule checking. Using a bidirectional long short-term memory model with a conditional random field layer, the computer can intelligently analyze constituents of building design rule sentences and automatically extract the logical elements. The proposed approach contributes to broadening the scope of building information modeling-enabled rule checking to any natural language-based design requirements.

This paper presents an overview of the project and the three volumes of documentation included in the final report (Clayton et al. 2013). The purpose of the project was to produce reference models and guidelines for developing software to automate thermal model creation from a building information model into a building energy simulation (BES) for energy simulations. This paper describes the methods of the research and presents highlights of the guidelines. The variety of uses for energy simulation in the building design process leads to a differentiation of several different kinds of thermal models that may be extracted from a BIM. A Series 2, Level 1 model that addresses whole-building energy use at schematic stages of design is developed into a set of guidelines. A recommendation is to use the centerlines of enclosure elements to determine areas of thermal surfaces. Various recommendations are made for resolving curved surfaces, shading elements, and site elements. The guidelines are supported by detailed sensitivity studies and analysis, presented in the final report (Clayton et al. 2013). The investigations led to identification of future work to improve energy simulation tools and BIM tools.

Using a number of basic building blocks widely available in commercial spreadsheet and matrix analysis software, it has proved possible to develop a new approach combining graphic displays and interactive processing. This allows a relatively inexperienced user to execute a full analysis and calculate reactances and time constants in less than three hours, starting from the raw data. Upper and lower peak time-constant envelopes are fitted using high-order polynomials or spline interpolation procedures. The latter are then used in compliance with IEEE and IEC recommendations to determine numerical values of T-d '', T-d '', x(d)', x(d) '' and T-a by graphical and heuristic reasoning, initially, simulated data was used to validate the new software and assess the effect of different time-scale decoupling windows on the parameter estimates. Despite its simplifying hypotheses and other inherent pitfalls discussed in the article, the present graphical method, we believe, should continue to be used, particularly as it is simple and fast enough to be applied directly in the field for test validation, or quick initialization of more advanced estimation procedures.

One major benefit is data and communications that enable customer-side resources to participate in electricity programs-i.e., transact with the electric grid. The U.S. Smart Grid activities and investments, which account for nearly three billion dollars in publicly documented expenses, build on interoperability standards activity. Standards interoperability for grid transactions can be viewed from two key interfaces-between (1) Smart Grid domain interfaces, and (2) customer-side resources and the electric grid. Conformance testing and certification is key to ensuring that standards are interoperable and secure. This paper describes the conformance development and certification process for a key communications standard-Open Automated Demand Response (OpenADR)-as an interface between customers' systems and electricity service providers, to enable demand response and price transactions. Through this process, we describe the benefits of conformance to support low-cost automated DR (AutoDR) and customer-side transactions within the distribution electric grid. The paper evaluates examples of applications and further developments for emerging transactive energy concepts that can be used to scale existing systems and to leverage the investments and support compliance to any building codes and appliance standards. The conformance process can be the key to realizing interoperability benefits and market acceptance. Conformance is also a key to enabling native DR and price transaction capabilities in customers' systems; a feature that can be replicated for diffusion and can lower DR technology costs by a significant margin.

An intuitive approach is the use of machine learning techniques based on specific network traffic characteristics. These traffic characteristics are also known as features, which have to be extracted and selected carefully to build robust and accurate learning models. Thus, finding the best possible learning model in combination with extracting the best possible feature-set is a necessary requirement to design accurate traffic classification models. While feature selection can be automated to find the best subset of a given set of features, there are no known mechanisms to solve the problem of feature extraction. Thus, extracting the best possible features has to be done empirically. In this work we present a framework to simplify the empirical model selection and feature extraction process.

In order to solve these, a large-scale data quality assessment and improvement program was started. The assessment sought to find data quality issues and prioritize cleaning tasks along different dimensions, such as reusability and complexity, while taking into account compliance and stakeholder happiness. Moreover, in doing these assessments, an attempt was made to isolate relatively easy to clean parts of the data in order to make them more feasible for people with less domain-knowledge. Finally, some of these data quality improvement operations turned out to be straightforward enough to fully automate them. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Automatically detecting fluid intake using conductivity measurements of beverages in a cup	2015 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (CASE)	IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE)	AUG 24-28, 2015	Gothenburg, SWEDEN	IEEE, IEEE Robotics & Automation Society, ABB, Chalmers, Wingquist Laboratory, City of Gothenburg, Cognibotics, Kuka, Volvo, AREUS, Information and communication technology				This contribution presents an automated approach to generate drinking protocols. This documentation process is used in nursing homes in order to prevent dehydration in elderly people. Smart cups are used to deduce fluid intake from filling levels. Electrodes at different vertical positions allow to detect discrete filling levels depending on the amount of beverage in the cup. A conductive sensor is combined with an inductive charging unit and a radio module in order to build a functional prototype with regard to food compliance, dishwasher compatibility and subtle appearance. An evaluation of the sensor has shown a strong influence of the beverage type. While water and most soft drinks result in unambiguous measurements, remnants, especially of milk, disturb an interpretation of sensor values severely. However, the prototype offers a reliable way to automatically monitor fluid intake of those unproblematic beverages.	[Kreutzer, Joachim F.; Ramesberger, Stefan; Reimer, Samuel M.

However, in real-world embedded distributed systems, it can be impossible, impractical, or too costly to gather enough field test data to make these evaluations in a straight-forward manner using traditional system testing alone. Instead, we need a method of verifying requirements compliance that uses the evidence available while minimizing the chances of wrong or misleading conclusions. This paper introduces the novel Forensic System Verification (FSV) Method, which combines modeling, data mining, analytic extrapolation, and goal modeling. It augments human inferences with automated reasoning about requirement satisfaction and confidence propagation. The FSV Method is evaluated on a case study performed using data from a recent medium-scale field trial of a complex distributed embedded system.

Causal networks for risk and compliance: Methodology and application	IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							NORMATIVE EXPERT-SYSTEMS; BAYESIAN NETWORKS; DIAGNOSIS	This paper presents a statistical approach to quantitatively measure the current exposure of a company to failures and defects in product quality or to compliance to government regulations. This approach is based on causal networks, which have previously been applied to other fields, such as systems maintenance and reliability. Causal networks allow analysts to causally explain the values of variables (an explanatory approach), to assess the effect of interventions on the structure of the data-generating process, and to evaluate "what-if" scenarios, that is, alternative methods or policies (an exploratory approach). Building the causal structure raises some challenges. In particular, there is no automated way to collect the needed data. We present a methodology for model selection and probability elicitation based on expert knowledge. We apply the proposed approach to the case of pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. The use of such networks allows for a more rigorous comparison of practices across different manufacturing sites, creates the opportunity for risk remediation, and allows us to evaluate alternative methods and approaches.

Greater savings and efficiency in the sector are expected through the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD). In the case of Spain, this directive is implemented through the Basic Energy-Saving Document of the Technical Building Code (CTE-DB-HE). This study presents an energy and environmental analysis of the EPBD implementation and evolution toward nearly zero-energy buildings (NZEBs) in a multi-family housing block. The locations of the studied building span 24 cities representative of the hot and temperate climate zones in Spain. This study complements a similar study conducted for the cold climate zones in Spain. The evolution of the regulation is studied through 5 cases and 3 proposals that seek to achieve NZEBs. The results reveal that reductions of more than 50% in energy demand, more than 68% in non-renewable primary energy consumption and more than 65% in CO2 emissions are achieved with the current regulation. In addition, this article shows how the CTE-DB-HE can evolve to achieve NZEBs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In many respects, the quality of future coverage is laid down by the manufacturability of the styling process, strict compliance with the requirements of project documentation and the existing building codes and regulations (GOST, ISO, etc.). However, the technology itself of the process of making asphalt concrete pavements is constantly evolving - new complexes are emerging, changes are being introduced to existing structures of machines for building coatings. Various factors can affect the durability of the coating; among them, the low quality of compaction of the asphalt concrete mixture can be especially noted. In this article, we will experimentally determine the effect of temperature on the quality of compaction, as well as analyze possible solutions to the problem of compliance with the temperature regime of the asphalt-concrete mixture. Addition, reduction and combination of operations of the technological process, including, against the background of improving the quality and, as a result, the durability of the coating, reduce the complexity of the work performed, reduce the number of necessary personnel - all this has a positive effect on the economic component of construction, frees up additional funds.

Construction 4.0 visions are based on automation and digitalisation, meaning that human site activities will require/stipulate changes. The extent to which manual tasks done by humans in construction will be replaced is uncertain. This might vary considering the context or type of work. Construction 4.0 includes craft workforce activities, as these can benefit from technology, fostering digital transformation in the short/medium term. The research scope is workforce innovation management using data from job sites. A framework is developed based on data future use involving electronic performance monitoring, building information modelling, smart contracts and artificial intelligence. A systematic scoping review is developed to identify legal/ethical issues in connection to technological aspects. The discussion and findings focus on General Data Protection Regulation compliance to apply the proposed framework. Optimised human machine-controlled environments must be ethically managed by pre-established collective agreements and must rely on each worker's awareness and consent. The findings suggest that the human aspects if improperly addressed could result in a bottleneck of digital transformation advances.

These items of highway planning are often complex and time consuming. Designing and comparing different alignment alternatives is even more time consuming and tends to be very costly. When planning for a new highway alignment, the general practice is to identify multiple alignment options and determine the best option based on multiple factors. This research proposes to automatically generate multiple alignment alternatives and the cut and fill quantities, costs, and schedules associated with each alternative in comparing different highway alignment alternatives. Building information modeling (BIM) technology has been increasingly used in resolving the complexity of a project in the building industry. However, the development of highway data schema and model using an object-oriented three-dimensional (3D) visualization is still underway and has not been fully implemented yet. This research proposes an object-oriented data model in compliance with ISO 10303 for highway design and construction. With the newly proposed data structure in highway design and construction, the automation of cost estimating and duration scheduling was achieved in identifying and comparing an optimum solution for alternative modeling and data output whose values provided aid in the selection process of design comparison. In summary, the explicit contribution to the body of knowledge that this paper claims is to propose a research procedure to improve current highway design and construction practices by applying a 3D object-oriented modeling approach to solve the problem of time-consuming highway planning related to alignment comparison.

The delivery compliance in the different building sites is one of the most significant aspects for both customer satisfaction and resource allocation in the RMC industry. To improve the decision-making process in the RMC industry, a multi-method (using a hybrid Agent-based and Discrete-Event simulation modeling technique) simulation model was created for a multinational company that produces and markets cement and ready-mixed concrete using software Arena, Rockwell Automation. The main contribution of this work is the novel approach to designing travel time to the construction sites, improving its validity and allowing us to optimize the production and delivery program. Results obtained in this project were used in the decision making process regarding the effective use of capital in installed capacity while minimizing risk.

In the paper, a detailed look is taken at the elements of reference and situation-based analysis of the representations of surface and in-depth semantics of semantic contexts in the sphere of business communication relying on the meaning-text theory for automated formalization of language structures and their matches by machine translation. The study is aimed at working out an algorithm that will enhance the quality of machine translation excluding intermediary natural languages and post-editing of translated texts. A distinguishing feature of the suggested approach is structurization and formalization of language structures on the stage of text pre-processing. Such << input filter >> of information will enable decoding system create literate messages in compliance with lexical and grammatical distributive principles both in a foreign language and native language, and use them for proofreading of texts in a native language and building structures that can be further translated by existing machine translation systems with high quality.

C	Taneja, O			ASHRAE	Taneja, Om			An Approach to Improved Indoor Air Quality and Operations of Buildings: Adopt Smart Buildings Technologies and Train Operations and Maintenance Staff for Required Competencies	ASHRAE TRANSACTIONS 2014, VOL 120, PT 1	ASHRAE Transactions		English	Proceedings Paper	ASHRAE Winter Conference	2014	New York, NY	ASHRAE				The concept of sustainability and high performance is leading public and private sectors to shift their strategic direction towards integrating smart building technologies and training of operations and maintenance staff into all aspects of design and construction. This process is transforming the investments in buildings towards multiple dimensions of workforce productivity, lower cost of utilities and services, brand image, environmental compliance, eco-friendliness, and corporate and social responsibility. However, efforts to sustain the intended sustainable performance with regards to low energy use, indoor comfort and projected operating costs over the long term use of the building has become challenging. Further adoption of intelligent buildings technology that provides monitoring, tracking, benchmarking, self-diagnostics and analytics for user-friendly guidance to the trained, certified and motivated operations staff can become an asset. After Construction, a Building operates for 40 to 100+ years and so integrating Operations & Maintenance into Design, Construction & Renovations is important for maintaining a more socially and environmentally responsible built-environment over the Life cycle of Facilities. Structured training of Buildings Managers and Operators can help in operational Improvements without significant capital needs. However, the skill gaps of O&M staff for making such changes need to be bridged. The U. S. government is faced with the ever-increasing challenge of managing the facilities and infrastructure. Along the recommendations of the Federal Facilities Council, the Congress passed, "FEDERAL BUILDING PERSONNEL TRAINING ACT OF 2010 - FBPTA" which mandates development of core competencies for facilities management and O&M staff. The required skills base includes a balance of technical, business, behavioral capabilities and enterprise knowledge. The report presents strategies to develop the workforce of the future, creation of an operating environment that supports professional development, and ways to measure progress towards the sustainment of core competencies. This presentation first focuses on the extent and scope of structured classroom and on the job training to promote the life-cycle mix of preventive, predictive and reliability-centered operations and maintenance "Best Practices". Traditional " Best Practices" need to be modified and strengthened for high performance buildings. It further emphasizes progressive efforts required for transforming existing and new buildings into " Smart Buildings" by installing sensors, smart meters and building automation systems and normalizing data. Use of Green Procurement, recycling program, regular sensor and equipment calibration, tracking and computerized maintenance management systems targeting reliability, safety, occupant comfort and changing workplace needs can facilitate meeting the goals.

Of 54 qualifying studies, we found that most used GSV to assess the neighborhood built environment, followed by health policy compliance, study site selection, and disaster preparedness. Most studies were conducted in urban areas of North America, Europe, or New Zealand, with few studies from South America or Asia and none from Africa or rural areas. Health behaviors and outcomes of interest in these studies included injury, alcohol and tobacco use, physical activity and mental health. Major strengths of using GSV imagery included low cost, ease of use, and time saved. Identified weaknesses were image resolution and spatial and temporal availability, largely in developing regions of the world. Despite important limitations, GSV is a promising tool for automated environmental assessment for health research. Currently untapped areas of health research using GSV include identification of sources of air, soil or water pollution, park design and usage, amenity design and longitudinal research on neighborhood conditions.

In contrast to approaches that leverage texture synthesis for creating decorative surface patterns, our method relies on user-defined spline curves as central design primitives. More specifically, we build on the physically-inspired metaphor of an embedded elastic curve that can move on a smooth surface, deform, and connect with other curves. We formalize this idea as a globally coupled energy-minimization problem, discretized with piece-wise linear curves that are optimized in the parametric space of a smooth surface. Building on this technical core, we propose a set of interactive design and editing tools that we demonstrate on manually-created layouts and semi-automated deformable packings. In order to prevent excessive compliance, we furthermore propose a structural analysis tool that uses eigenanalysis to identify potentially large deformations between geodesically-close curves and guide the user in strengthening the corresponding regions. We used our approach to create a variety of designs in simulation, validated with a set of 3D-printed physical prototypes.

A framework for building privacy-conscious composite web services	ICWS 2006: IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WEB SERVICES, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2006)	SEP 18-22, 2006	Chicago, IL	IEEE Comp Soc, TCSC				The rapid growth of web applications has prompted increasing interest in the area of composite web services that involve several service providers. The potential for such composite web services can be realized only if consumer privacy concerns are satisfactorily addressed. In this paper we propose a framework that addresses consumer privacy concerns in the context of highly customizable composite web services. Our approach involves service producers exchanging their terms-of-use with consumers in the form of,'models". Our framework provides automated techniques for checking these models at the consumer site for compliance of consumer privacy policies. In the event of a policy violation, our framework supports automatic generation of "obligations" that the consumer generates for the composite service. These obligations are automatically enforced through a dynamic program analysis approach on the web service composition code. We illustrate our approach with the implementation of two example services.	[Xu, Wei; Venkatakrishnan, V. N.; Sekar, R.; Ramakrishnan, I.

Any deviation appeared after building commissioning will result non-compliance with regulatory requirements. Currently, the energy simulations of the residential building do not provide the approach, which would help comprehensively evaluate differences of occupants' characteristics (age, behaviour, etc.), neither in energy performance certification methodologies nor in energy simulation software. The objective of study is to perform complex analysis of the effect of domestic occupancy profiles on the energy performance of energy efficient house and assess applicability of default DesignBuilder occupancy profiles at local conditions. Results show that the influence of the profile with 4 occupants (OP2) on overall primary energy demand for different cases is never exceeding 5% compared to default DesignBuilder profiles. The influence of households with 2 occupants (OP3, OP4) on overall primary energy demand varies from 14% to 21% compared to default profiles. The simulation results revealed that the use of different occupancy profiles correlates with the total energy performance of the building.

J	Lagrange, FJ; Lagrange, JV				Lagrange, Fabrice Jean; Lagrange, Jean Valdomar			Process performance of a new liquid medication dispensing robot	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL PHARMACY			English	Article; Early Access						validation studies; liquid medication; tapering; automation; packaging		Objectives Liquid medications provide an alternative to splitting pills and dosages by measuring an amount of liquid rather than crushing tablets or opening capsules. Special attention should also be paid to specific patient groups with swallowing difficulties or requiring enteral feeding administration. Liquid medicines are also often used to ease withdrawal symptoms for people suffering from addiction. Nevertheless, filling liquid medication cups with the right medication and precise doses may be difficult for healthcare professionals. The Nooddis ('Nominative Oral Dose Dispenser'-Pierre Loo Hospital, France and Packinov, France) is a new robotic system for the automated filling of single dose liquid medications. Since the performance of such a complex piece of equipment depends on compliance of the service provider to our building guidelines, the process performance verification is a necessary prerequisite before starting routine production. Methods The performance of the Nooddis robot (accuracy, precision, and tapering calculation) and its ability to fill medicine cups was evaluated with 18 different liquid medications using an automatic in-line checkweigher. Microbiological testing was also performed. Results 648 sealed cups were prepared for qualification. The filling accuracy was within the limit of +/- 10% from 75 mu L to 21.25 mL. The repeatability (% relative SD (%RSD) 0.05 to 4.93) and intermediate precision (%RSD 0.01 to 6.59) were validated for all preparations. All medicine cups met the requirements of USP and European Pharmacopoeia acceptance criteria for microbiological quality. Automated tapering calculations allowed for easy production of daily doses for the tapering periods chosen. Conclusion Since the system met the required quality standards, the Nooddis robot, with automatic in-line tapering system, is regarded as an accurate technology that can fill the exact amount of liquid oral medication in single dose cups. This may promote closer monitoring, which supports medication tapering as well as medication misuse prevention. With a packaging cost similar to current unit dose cup systems, it is a relevant alternative to fractioned or crushed tablets, as well as opened capsules. Further developments for some sterile liquid medications are yet to be studied.

We present an automated and effective approach for the detection of implicit information leaks in business process execution language (BPEL) based on information flow analysis. We introduce an adequate meta-model for BPEL representation based on a Petri net for transformation and analysis. Building on the concept of Petri net place-based noninterference, the core contribution of this paper is the application of a Petri net reachability graph to estimate Petri net interference and thereby to detect implicit information leaks in web service composition. In addition, a case study illustrates the application of the approach on a concrete workflow in BPEL notation.

Their rationale is to convey data providers with a sense of control over the disclosure and usage of personal data to varying degree, so that they can take an active role in protecting their privacy. However, we purport the thesis that a holistic sense of control includes not only the regulation of disclosure, as identity management techniques currently do, but must equivalently comprise the supervision of compliance, i.e. credible evidence that data consumers behave according to the policies previously agreed upon. Despite its relevance, supervision has so far not been possible. We introduce the concept of privacy evidence and present the necessary technical building blocks to realise it in dynamic systems.

'Form-active structure systems are structure systems of flexible, non-rigid matter, in which the redirection of forces is effected through particular FORM DESIGN and characteristic FORM STABILISATION.'(i). FORMFINDER offers the designer an intuitional step by step design path of three design stages. After a preliminary design stage using a physical model and the FORMFINDER software simulation, the designer is presented with an evaluation of the design. By means of automated object recognition, each design is described geometrically and recognised in context. The description allows the design to be matched with reference projects or construction solutions for example. The now introduced third design stage is extended with a unique classification characterising the "context and life-cycle management". As "Form follows Finance"(ii) form-active structures can offer additional value with respect to their economic aspect. The idea is to visualise added economic values in the context of life-cycle management. The economic idea of life-cycle management does not start with a sketch or end with a "physical event". Life-cycle management has to start and end by collecting the values of "what effects the Form" in terms of "building events". Building events represent an additional view to consistent database fields. Building events can be represented with a taxonomy of "event types". Event types should model for example the economic execution of construction work, material decisions and the details and operation of a building depend closely on design decisions. The following examples are intended to give an idea of the dependency of "Form follows ... " Event energy consumption: Fabrication for example the level of prefabrication affects energy consumption and quality. Transport for example the general public has an interest in a reduction of site traffic. Energy to erect, energy to operate or energy to dismantle. Event change on-site: On-site reorganisation for example erection of a new building incorporating the existing, conversion, component change or renewal. Off-site reorganisations e.g. change of building code, change of neighbourhood, change of adjoining structures, plants, streets. Event change of application: Extension or conversion of a building e.g. from industrial use to a leisure facility. Event change of ownership: Change of ownership can affect a building in different ways. Interest of the building owner could be part of the project description. Event change of environment: Geographic changes, e.g. earthquake, global warming, pollution, increased need for sun protection. Alignment of approaches such as those mentioned could create additional value and higher quality in the discussion of form-active structures. These values will support decision makers when choosing form-active structures.

As built energy need and detailed measured input data is applied in building model calibration procedure. Calibrated building model energy performance is studied in both measured and test reference year climate conditions. Previously modelled as built plant automation and implemented control logics are compared against measured. Geothermal plant in this study consists of heat pump, solar collectors, boreholes and energy piles. Heat pump SCOP estimated by post processing according to heat pump manufacturer's performance map is compared against measured SCOP on the monthly basis. Opinion on actual plant operation is given and energy performance improvement potential is quantified. Important parameters for successful building model calibration are presented. Building compliance with Finland NZEB requirements are assessed. The results show good match with measured energy use after the model calibration.

This study aimed to investigate arterial compliance as evaluated by automated recording of the QKd interval in patients who underwent repair of coarctation by construction of a subclavian flap compared with those who underwent resection of the narrowed aortic segment with end-to-end anastomosis. Thirty-nine children who underwent surgical repair of aortic coarctation by subclavian flap (n = 19) and by end-to-end anastomosis (n = 20) were enrolled. Arterial stiffness was measured by the noninvasive QKd 100-60 method. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and a transthoracic echocardiography were also performed. The group of patients who had an end-to-end anastomosis showed better results regarding 24-hour blood pressure profile and QKD 100-60 value compared with those underwent construction of a subclavian flap. Surgical repair of aortic obstruction by end-to-end anastomosis demonstrates better preservation of arterial distensibility than those repaired by subclavian flap. Therefore, it appears to be advantageous, whenever possible, to use the end-end anastomosis approach, which appears to lessen the incidence of the most common complications after aortic arch surgery.

The reliability of a business process can be increased through modelling of the process before the implementation of code, followed by the verification of its correctness. Verification of a business process involves checking whether the process in question behaves as it was designed to behave. Model checking is a technology widely used for the automated system verification And represents a technique for verifying that finite state systems satisfy specifications expressed in the language of temporal logics. Formal verification of business process models aims checking for process correctness and business compliance. This paper presents a suitable approach for automatic verification of a business process using Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL). In development of a user-friendly supporting tool, we will use our original ATL model checker.

A complex function of the system can be achieved by a single optical element. Free form elements are usually manufactured by reproduction techniques, such as injection moulding of plastic. Manufacturing tolerances are crucial to maintain the required function while at the same time yielding the lowest possible price. We implemented a Monte Carlo tolerancing method for illumination systems. Tolerances include shape deviations of optical elements and assembly tolerances. In the absence of standards for free form tolerances and illumination optics tolerancing, communication between optics design, manufacturing and testing is often inefficient. In order to enable a highly automated evaluation of part measurement data to assess compliance with tolerances, we developed an approach to combine information from optics design, mechanical construction, manufacturing and testing into one continuous data chain.

This device offers the promise of regulation of volume status and provision of adequate solute clearances, while at the same time allowing its user to receive continuous therapy while going on with the normal activities of daily life. An important component of such a therapy is the ability to remotely monitor the treatment. This remote monitoring allows assurance of patient safety through surveillance of critical portions of the treatment as well as the ability to monitor compliance with prescribed therapy and automated collection of treatment data. Recent advances in telemedicine, telemonitoring, remote network access and sensor technologies have made such remote monitoring of the WAK feasible. Furthermore, experience with remote monitoring for nocturnal hemodialysis, which shares some similarities with the needs of the WAK for monitoring, can guide implementation of such a system.

J	Gholizadeh, P; Esmaeili, B; Goodrum, P				Gholizadeh, Pouya; Esmaeili, Behzad; Goodrum, Paul			Diffusion of Building Information Modeling Functions in the Construction Industry	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							CODE COMPLIANCE CHECKING; INNOVATION DIFFUSION; BIM ADOPTION; TECHNOLOGY; DESIGN; REQUIREMENTS; VISUALIZATION; SELECTION; SCHEDULE; ISO-9000	While advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs) have enabled architects, engineers, and contractors to reduce project time and cost and to improve quality, the diffusion of ICTs has typically been very slow in the construction industry. However, building information modeling (BIM) has overcome this diffusion challenge and has revolutionized such common practices as shifting the design process from two-dimensional (2D) drafting toward three-dimensional (3D) design, automated quantity takeoffs, and clash detection; such success marks the relevance of this technology for studying how technological innovations spread throughout the construction industry. Although some studies have explored BIM adoption, investigations using diffusion models to study the diffusion patterns of different BIM functions (e.g., 3D visualization, clash detection, energy modeling) are missing from the current literature. To fill this gap, this study uses reliable innovation diffusion models to describe the diffusion patterns of various BIM functions in the U.S. construction industry. Specifically, this study developed and sent a comprehensive questionnaire to 3,017 owner representatives, architects, and project managers; 118 individuals responded to the survey, of whom 81 are BIM users. The three most widely adopted BIM functions were 3D visualization, clash detection, and constructability analysis; the least frequently implemented functions were code validation; material tracking, delivery, and management; facility management; and energy analysis. Using these responses, this study analyzed the diffusion patterns of the BIM functions using four innovation diffusion models: internal (logistic), external, Bass, and Gompertz. Using such measures as Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and variants of it, this study identified the Bass model as having the highest explanatory power for diffusion and determined that internal factors (e.g., imitation and bandwagon pressure) have the most influence on adoption rates of BIM functions. Furthermore, the diffusion models showed that the shop-drawing process and facility management functions had the lowest saturation rate in 2014 (below 50%) but have a greater potential for being adopted in coming years. The findings of this study advance knowledge for both researchers and practitioners regarding the adoption process of different BIM functions and provide a theoretical basis for understanding the diffusion patterns of ICT innovations in the construction industry.

J	Nguyen, VH; Dashevskyi, S; Massacci, F				Nguyen, Viet Hung; Dashevskyi, Stanislav; Massacci, Fabio			An automatic method for assessing the versions affected by a vulnerability	EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Software security; Empirical validation; Vulnerability analysis; National vulnerability database (NVD); Browsers		Vulnerability data sources are used by academics to build models, and by industry and government to assess compliance. Errors in such data sources therefore not only are threats to validity in scientific studies, but also might cause organizations, which rely on retro versions of software, to lose compliance. In this work, we propose an automated method to determine the code evidence for the presence of vulnerabilities in retro software versions. The method scans the code base of each retro version of software for the code evidence to determine whether a retro version is vulnerable or not. It identifies the lines of code that were changed to fix vulnerabilities. If an earlier version contains these deleted lines, it is highly likely that this version is vulnerable. To show the scalability of the method we performed a large scale experiments on Chrome and Firefox (spanning 7,236 vulnerable files and approximately 9,800 vulnerabilities) on the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). The elimination of spurious vulnerability claims (e.g. entries to a vulnerability database such as NVD) found by our method may change the conclusions of studies on the prevalence of foundational vulnerabilities.

Based on the requirements of human-machine collaboration, the characteristics of variable admittance control are analyzed by taking the large aircraft components as the assembly object, and the specific implementation methods of variable admittance control based on operation intention recognition for different phases of the auxiliary assembly process are studied. Later, the force signal processing is simulated and an auxiliary assembly test prototype is built to verify the conclusion. The results show that using the proposed method can effectively improve the phenomenon of reverse acceleration mutation and contact bounce of robot, then the robot's compliance and assembly efficiency in the process of auxiliary assembly are enhanced.

NJ Transit contracted the UK firm DeltaRail to design, build and install three ARVIS installations at its new Morrisville, PA maintenance facility and to support them during a two-year trial. DeltaRail has installed a number of similar systems in Europe over the past 10 years, but the NJ TRANSIT project is the first example of ARVIS technology being put to use in the western hemisphere. To provide local support DeltaRail worked with ENSCO as its US partner on this project. The installation at Morrisville comprises three identical ARVIS systems covering all entry tracks into the yard. Each trackside system measures wheel profile, axle-mounted disc brake pads, wheel-mounted disc brake pads, tread brake shoes and wheel roundness. A total of 36 cameras (12 for each system) are used, making this the world's largest automated visual inspection system for rail vehicles. The system became operational in April 2008. The measurement information and images from each trackside system is sent by a high-speed communications link to an ENSCO-hosted data server. The measurements for every component are added to an Information Display System, which builds historic wear trends, predicts remaining component life and highlights problems causing abnormal wear rates. Access to the information is available globally through a secure internet account. It is anticipated that the data from ARVIS will provide a better understanding of the current and future state of equipment. This predictive information will improve management by reducing maintenance costs, increasing maintenance efficiency, improving safety, optimizing associated consumable costs and demonstrating compliance with standards to regulatory bodies. Additionally, the potential exists to reduce the frequency of manual inspections in the hazardous areas beneath trains while still meeting all FRA inspection requirements, allowing maintenance staff to concentrate their efforts on repairs. This paper describes the installed systems, shows some of the initial results and discusses how the information will be used to deliver the expected benefits.

Design and optimization of a novel bio-loom to weave melt-spun absorbable polymers for bone tissue engineering	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART B-APPLIED BIOMATERIALS			English	Article						melt-spinning; woven scaffold; mesh; bio-loom; bone tissue engineering	STEM-CELLS; SCAFFOLDS	Bone graft procedures are currently among the most common surgical procedures performed worldwide, but due to high risk of complication and lack of viable donor tissue, there exists a need to develop alternatives for bone defect healing. Tissue engineering, for example, combining biocompatible scaffolds withmesenchymal stem cells to achieve new bone growth, is a possible solution. Recent work has highlighted the potential for woven polymer meshes to serve as bone tissue engineering scaffolds; since, scaffolds can be iteratively designed by adjusting weave settings, material types, and mesh parameters. However, there are a number of material and system challenges preventing the implementation of such a tissue engineering strategy. Fiber compliance, tensile strength, brittleness, cross sectional geometry, and size present specific challenges for using traditional textile weaving methods. In the current work, two potential scaffold materials, melt-spun poly-L-lactide, and poly-L-lactide-co-e-caprolactone, were investigated. An automated bio-loom was engineered and built to weave these materials. The bio-loom was used to successfully demonstrate the weaving of these difficult-to-handle fiber types into various mesh configurations and material combinations. The dob by-loom design, adapted with an air jet weft placement system, warp tension control system, and automated collection spool, provides minimal damage to the polymer fibers while overcoming the physical constraints presented by the inherent material structure.

It is also essential to combine cybersecurity within the SCMS. In an effort to move towards smart grid, the Dubai Electricity & Water Authority (DEWA) initiated a long-term contract for the supply, installation, testing, and commissioning of 33 substations (132/11 kV) with modern automation systems for transmission power substations. DEWA has very strict requirements in terms of system availability, reliability, performance, cybersecurity, Ethernet network resiliency, and protection and communications redundancy. An HMI is included in the SCMS for local indication and control. Status, metering, and control data to the local HMI and remote utility enterprise system is provided by a redundant SCADA system. Reliable and secure communications to support mission-critical, high-speed protection schemes is achieved by an Ethernet network of utility-grade operational technology (OT) switches, not IT switches. The Ethernet network uses a modified ladder topology with IEC 62439 Part 1 Spanning Tree Algorithm (STA) via Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) for network resiliency and IEC 62439 Part 3 Parallel Redundancy Protocol (PRP) for message duplication. Data segregation and traffic control in the SCMS network is provided by IEEE 802.1 VLANs. The data acquisition and control along with engineering access and event report collection is accomplished using manufacturing message specification (MMS), whereas high-speed signal exchange for peer-to-peer protection schemes is accomplished using GOOSE communications protocols from the IEC 61850 communications standard. The DEWA technical SCMS specifications were built around the concept of future proofing and backward compatibility to support the evolution of smart grid capabilities by accepting smart technological advancements and future development of substation automation system features. It is strongly believed that the technical improvements made in DEWA specifications will lay a solid foundation for a sustainable automation system in DEWA over the years to come. Because DEWA is aware of the risks of digitizing substation communications networks and the recent increase in the number of cyberattacks against utilities that involve abusing vulnerabilities in the security of their communications networks, DEWA has strict cybersecurity requirements to prevent cyberinduced power outages that could potentially disrupt an electric power grid. The SCMS was designed with the holistic approach of a defense-in-depth philosophy, including supply chain security and physical security. The DEWA SCMS security design relies on a multilayer security zone approach to provide a scalable cybersecurity solution that automates tasks, streamlines operations, and improves performance. This paper discusses DEWA system requirements developed to facilitate the safe, reliable, and economical delivery of power in Emirate of Dubai. This is followed by a discussion of various engineering decisions that resulted from lessons learned during the design stage of the DEWA transmission power substation automation system to ensure that the system is ready for future smart grid requirements. Various analysis tools and testing techniques are described in the paper that were used to quantify the performance attributes of the IEC 61850-based system design. This project proves that with the right engineering design and a properly configured Ethernet network that uses best engineering practices for OT, performance, interoperability, and compliance to standards can coexist.

Our approach utilizes a graphical editor through which the user can express a subset of an object's state to be marshaled and sent across a network. Our tool, MPI Serializer, then automatically generates efficient marshaling and unmarshaling code for use with the Message Passing Interface (MPI), the predominant communication middleware for HPC systems. Our approach provides a more comprehensive level of support for C++ language features than the existing state of the art, and does so in full compliance with the C++ Language Standard. Specifically, we can marshal effectively and efficiently non-trivial language constructs such as polymorphic pointers, dynamically allocated arrays, non-public member fields, inherited members, and STL container classes. Additionally, our marshaling approach is also applicable to third part), libraries, as it does not require any modifications to the existing C++ source code. We validate our approach through two case studies of applying our tool to automatically generate the marshaling functionality of two realistic HPC applications. The case studies demonstrate that the automatically generated code matches the performance of typical hand-written implementations and surpasses current state-of-the-art C++ marshaling libraries, in some cases by more than an order of magnitude. The results of our case studies indicate that our approach can be beneficial for both the initial construction of HPC applications as well as for the refactoring of sequential applications for parallel execution.

TREADMILL WALKING OF THE PNEUMATIC BIPED LUCY: WALKING AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS AND STEP-LENGTHS	INTERNATIONAL APPLIED MECHANICS			English	Article						bipedal walking robot; pneumatic artificial muscle	DYNAMICS; ROBOT; MODEL	Actuators with adaptable compliance are gaining interest in the field of legged robotics due to their capability to store motion energy and to exploit the natural dynamics of the system to reduce energy consumption while walking and running. To perform research on compliant actuators we have built the planar biped Lucy. The robot has six actuated joints, the ankle, knee and hip of both legs with each joint powered by two pleated pneumatic artificial muscles in an antagonistic setup. This makes it possible to control both the torque and the stiffness of the joint. Such compliant actuators are used in passive walkers to overcome friction when walking over level ground and to improve stability. Typically, this kind of robots is only designed to walk with a constant walking speed and step-length, determined by the mechanical design of the mechanism and the properties of the ground. In this paper, we show that by an appropriate control, the robot Lucy is able to walk at different speeds and step-lengths and that adding and releasing weights does not affect the stability of the robot. To perform these experiments, an automated treadmill was built	[Vanderborght, B.] Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Mech Engn, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; Italian Inst Techol Robot Brain & Cognit Sci, I-16163 Genoa, Italy	Vanderborght, B (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel, Dept Mech Engn, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.

Design of IFPs that adhere to the criteria developed by the FAA to ensure safe flight can be a tedious, iterative task. This is particularly true in areas with complex obstacle/terrain environments. Previous work was conducted by MITRE to develop criteria modules (CM) capable of analyzing a procedure design's compliance with FAA criteria. In this paper, these engines are leveraged to evaluate batches of candidate procedures. To ensure convergence to an acceptable solution in a reasonable period, a modified depth-first search algorithm was designed to mimic the general design flow used by human procedure designers. By combining this algorithm with the capability of the CMs and a batch cluster for analyzing multiple procedures in parallel, it is shown that procedures can be built in tightly constrained situations by adapting common algorithms to the specific requirements of IFP design.

By utilizing Business Process Management Systems (BPMS), organizations can streamline and automate tasks, reduce turnaround time, and help ensure regulatory compliance. The foremost considerations when enterprises deploy BPM solutions involve supportive system functions, friendly Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) and maximal Return on Investment (ROI), based on the specific processes required, organizational management, and working style of their particular business environment. In order to address the problems associated with BPMS customization, for the flexible coverage of various requirements, this paper takes a three step approach. First, limited customization support of commercial and academic BPMS is reviewed in favor of open source BPMS. Then, advantageous features of uEngine, an open source BPMS which supports flexible customization, are introduced. Finally, API-based and component-based customization in building a BPM application utilizing uEngine is introduced with illustrative examples.

However, the resulting test scripts may require long execution times, due to their interaction with the browser GUI and backend services. To avoid repeated and costly setup of the Web application state, testers tend to build test suites whose test scripts depend on each other (i.e., one test case sets up the application state expected by another test case). In this paper we present STILE, a tool for the parallel execution of Web test scripts that ensures the compliance of all execution schedules with the dependencies among the involved test scripts, while at the same time minimizing the execution time and the computation time required for such parallel execution. Experimental results show that execution times can be approximately halved thanks to STILE.

Although building automation systems and advanced control strategies aim to address this issue by improving adaptability to partial occupancy, no holistic metrics exist to quantify this aspect of building performance. To this end, we present a technology-independent approach to define adaptability as a building performance attribute and introduce metrics to quantify it. These metrics can be used to evaluate how different building technologies and control strategies influence building operations' adaptability to variable occupancy or estimate their associated energy savings. To demonstrate these metrics, a case study based on simulating a single-story office building was used to compare several control strategies with regards to their effect on improving adaptability. Results showed how the proposed metrics highlighted the additional benefits of these control strategies, especially under low-occupancy scenarios. Performance-based compliance with building energy codes and standards typically assumes full or near full occupancy, which may underestimate the benefits of adaptable building technologies or controls. Therefore, incorporating adaptability metrics in energy codes and operational guidelines would quantify the benefits of adaptable systems, especially under variable occupancy.

The Cooperative's Centre for Health Promotion is responsible for the overall planning, implementation and evaluation of the influenza campaign. The model for delivering influenza immunizations has been designed to build on the strengths and capabilities of a staff model HMO with sophisticated automated information systems. The model permits area medical centres (AMCs) and physicians to use the materials and intervention strategies generated by the Centre for Health Promotion, while at the same time allowing them flexibility to design and use their own intervention strategies to increase compliance. More importantly, the model reduces resource requirements on AMCs and physicians to plan and maintain internal immunization efforts. Recommendations for improving the influenza campaign are discussed. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Emission sources are initially screened based on their visible opacity via US EPA Method 9 standard. Nowadays, it is rather surprising that opacity is still visually determined by human eyes with smoke school training and semi-annual certification. Nonetheless, opacity alone doesn't reveal particle concentration and size distribution which is crucial to determine PM values. It would be desirable to have an automated, calibratable device to make such a measurement with higher accuracy and reliability and is not available to date. We present our preliminary work on developing a compact, hand portable system capable of quantitatively determining plume optical opacity in combination with possible particle concentration and size distribution (and hence PM) measurement for standoff distances up to 150 meters. Our benchtop lidar-based system was built with a frequency-doubled Q-switched Nd:YAG laser and an optical receiver. We have demonstrated the feasibility of a remote-capable optical sensor system for real-time continuous monitoring of visible emission plumes and its effectiveness for quantitative opacity measurement. The hand-portable Remote Plume Particulate Matter (RPPM) meter being developed will be capable of determining opacity and PM load from remote PM sources will provide a regulatory compliance solution for visible emissions from sources for environmental studies, industrial and military applications.

The model is built for agricultural plant treatment procedures without external sensors, as contact forces are estimated from joint torques and robot's dynamic and kinematic model. By devising an impedance-based exploratory control algorithm capable of following an unknown shape, while being provided with only a general direction in which to explore, we eliminate the need for a precise position controller. Our approach is validated through experiments with several mock-up plant stems, showing that the proposed framework is capable of building a satisfactory 3D model of a plant. The method is evaluated against the ground truth model, and compared to the state of the art approach based on an industrial manipulator with external sensors.

Simulation tools offer the opportunity to test robotic applications before the physical existence of the system, to ensure reachability and feasibility of the actual cell implementation and examine compliance with the desired cycle time during process execution. During simulation analysis, extracting data from the given layout and building the corresponding simulation model takes a considerable amount of time. To reduce the required time, one applicable approach is to automate the generation of the simulation model using data from tools used prior to the simulation analysis, such as layout planning tools. So far, data representation limits the straightforward data exchange between planning and simulation tools and constitutes a time-consuming task during simulative ramp up. This paper focuses on the automatic layout generation in a 3D simulation environment. To enable automatic layout generation, a suitable representation of the imported layout data is derived. For this purpose, available data exchange formats are compared and their suitability for automatic model generation is evaluated. As a result of the evaluation, AutomationML is identified to meet the requirements best. Using this format, the development of an interface is described, which makes it possible to import layout data into the simulation environment of Visual Components and automatically generate a simulation-model of the complete robotic cell layout.

J	Tan, WC; Chua, KH; Wu, YL				Chian Tan, Wei; Hian Chua, Kie; Wu, Yanling			The Automated Risk Estimation for the Navigation of Autonomous Ships by Learning with Navigation Feature	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL METHODS			English	Article						Autonomous ships; navigation planning; historical AIS data; machine learning		This work presents a data-driven approach for the automated risk estimation of the voyage of a vessel or ship. While the industry is moving from a compliance-based framework with existing rules to a risk-based one, there is also a need to monitor the risk of a vessel from the perspective of the navigation. This is of even higher importance for the case of autonomous ships. Built based on the state-of-the-art mathematical representation, the navigation feature, each existing voyage is transformed into a corresponding series of points in d-dimensional space. During the stage of pre-processing, given a set of historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, those records that belong to the same vessel within a certain period of time are taken as a voyage and mapped to the corresponding space of the navigation feature. After the pre-processing and during the online monitoring, the current trajectory of the vessel is transformed into the corresponding representation in the same way. Based on a nearest-neighbor search scheme, the distance from the nearest neighbor is taken as the risk of the current voyage. In other words, the deviation from the closest route in the historical data is taken as the risk. The developed method has demonstrated encouraging performance on a set of challenging historical AIS data from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, covering three regions in the Australian territory, namely, the Bass Strait, the Great Australian Bight and the North West.

The problem is that this type of system introduces an added difficulty since they present a strong dependence on the meteorology and the mobility needs of the users. This problem forces the distribution system operators to seek tools that make it possible to balance the relationship between consumption and generation. In this sense, automated demand response systems are an appropriate solution that allow the operator to request specific reductions in customers' consumption, offering a discount to the customer and avoiding network congestion. This paper analyzes the implementation and architecture of a demand response solution based on OpenADR standard and its possible integration with a building management system through a use case. As will be analyzed, a key part of the architecture is the measurement system based on smart meters acting as sensors. This is the base of the auditing system which makes it possible to verify compliance with the consumption reduction agreements. Additionally, this study is completed with a parallel auditing system which makes it possible to verify compliance with the consumption reduction agreements. All of the proposed demand response cycle is implemented as a proof of concept in a classroom in the Escuela Politecnica Superior at the University of Seville, which makes it possible to identify the advantages of this architecture in the ambit of connection between distribution network and buildings.

However, due to the enforcement of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), certain WHOIS data (i.e., the records about EEA, or the European Economic Area, registrants) needs to be redacted before being released to the public. Anecdotally, it was reported that actions have been taken by some WHOIS providers. Yet, so far there is no systematic study to quantify the changes made by the WHOIS providers in response to the GDPR, their strategies for data redaction and impact on other applications relying on WHOIS data. In this study, we report the first large-scale measurement study to answer these questions, in hopes of guiding the enforcement of the GDPR and identifying pitfalls during compliance. This study is made possible by analyzing a collection of 1.2 billion WHOIS records spanning two years. To automate the analysis tasks, we build a new system GCChecker based on unsupervised learning, which assigns a compliance score to a provider. Our findings of WHOIS GDPR compliance are multi-fold. To highlight a few, we discover that the GDPR has a profound impact on WHOIS, with over 85% surveyed large WHOIS providers redacting EEA records at scale. Surprisingly, over 60% large WHOIS data providers also redact non-EEA records. A variety of compliance flaws like incomplete redaction are also identified. The impact on security applications is prominent and redesign might be needed. We believe different communities (security, domain and legal) should work together to solve the issues for better WHOIS privacy and utility.

Parties' actions influence the status of a contract and shall comply with its clauses. Manual contract monitoring is very laborious in real markets, such as transactive energy, where plenty of complex contracts are running concurrently. Furthermore, liability, right and performance transition through run-time operations such as subcontracting, assignment and substitution complicate contract interpretation. Automation is needed to ensure that contracts respect desirable properties and to support monitoring of compliance and handling of violations. In this thesis research, I propose an innovative ontology that defines fundamental contractual notions (such as the ones mentioned above) and their relationships, on which is built a specification language, called Symboleo, that provides syntax and axiomatic semantics of contracts via first-order logic.

Integrating Natural Language Processing and Spatial Reasoning for Utility Compliance Checking	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Underground utility; Compliance checking; Natural language processing (NLP); Spatial reasoning; Geographical information system (GIS); Information technologies	INFORMATION; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM; BIM	Underground utility incidents, such as utility conflicts and utility strikes, result in time and cost overruns in construction projects, property damages, environmental pollution, personnel injuries, and fatalities. A main cause of recurrent utility incidents is the noncompliance with the spatial configurations between utilities and their surroundings. Utility specifications usually contain textual descriptions of the spatial configurations. However, detection of spatial defects, according to the textual descriptions, is difficult and time consuming. This deficiency is because of the lack of spatial cognition in many rule-checking systems to process massive amounts of data. This study aims to automate utility compliance checking by integrating natural language processing (NLP) and spatial reasoning. NLP algorithm translates the textual descriptions of spatial configurations into computer-processable spatial rules. Spatial reasoning executes the extracted spatial rules following a logical order in a geographical information system (GIS) to identify noncompliance. The intellectual contribution of this study is twofold. First, complex spatial rules are retrieved automatically from textual data with their hierarchies classified, which provides the inputs and indicates the sequence of rule execution in spatial reasoning. Second, semantic spatial relations are modeled on the basis of their metric and topological implications, enabling the automatic execution of multiple spatial rules. Experiments were conducted to test this framework. The average precision, recall, and combination of the two (F-measure) achieved by the NLP algorithm for extracting spatial rules are 87.88%, 79.09%, and 83.25%, respectively. In addition, the spatial reasoning mechanism also was found to be a powerful tool for compliance checking under various scenarios.

Traditional approaches based on Building Automation and Control Systems consider buildings equipped with many different sensors. Unfortunately, the sensors are not always placed for taking the measurements at the right positions. Besides, users could feel a negative perception due to continuous supervision. The present work proposes an approach based on a social humanoid robot that monitors indoor environmental quality. It friendly interacts with occupants providing appropriate suggestions. Particularly, the social robot has been endowed with cognitive capabilities that ground on (i) a proper ontology that formalizes the IEQ domain, (ii) on formal definitions of normative standards based on deontic logic, and (iii) on algorithms for reasoning about the compliance of the environment with the normative standards. The proposed approach has been experimentally verified in some offices of the National Research Council of Italy located in Palermo, and it has involved ten participants. It is worth noting that at the end of the measurement campaign appears that in some cases, compliance with the standard does not imply the user's well-being and vice versa.

Unfortunately, they also introduce new challenges in SoC testing, such as core test reuse and the need of a common test infrastructure working with cores originating from different vendors. The IEEE 1500 Standard for Embedded Core Testing addresses these issues by proposing a flexible hardware test wrapper architecture for embedded cores, together with a core test language (CTL) used to describe the implemented wrapper functionalities. Several intellectual property providers have already announced IEEE Standard 1500 compliance in both existing and future design blocks. In this paper, we address the problem of guaranteeing the compliance of a wrapper architecture and its CTL description to the IEEE Standard 1500. This step is mandatory to fully trust the wrapper functionalities in applying the test sequences to the core. We present a systematic methodology to build a verification framework for IEEE Standard 1500 compliant cores, allowing core providers and/or integrators to verify the compliance of their products (sold or purchased) to the standard.

J	Shen, YL; Shirinzadeh, B				Shen, YL; Shirinzadeh, B			Dynamic analysis of reconfigurable fixture construction by a manipulator	ROBOTICS AND COMPUTER-INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING			English	Article							MOTION; INSERTION; SYSTEM; DESIGN	In a reconfigurable workholding system, the precise manipulation of fixture mechanisms by robot manipulators is performed against external kinematic constraints. Automation of such tasks requires development of dynamic model that can be utilised for establishment of control strategies. The sliding lower pairs form the basic structure of the fixture mechanisms; thus dynamic analysis of adjustment operations on sliding pairs becomes essential. In this paper, four types of fixture mechanisms for the reconfigurable workholding system are briefly presented. Sliding pairs are identified and briefly described as the basic structure of fixture mechanisms. Geometric and dynamic analyses for robotic adjustment of sliding pairs with built-in compliance are presented. The requirements to successfully perform the height adjustment of such sliding pairs with various geometric parameters are discussed. By taking into consideration the inertial forces and moments, constraint inequalities are obtained to ensure jam-free condition on sliding pairs during adjustment operations.

PRAGMATIC EVALUATION OF SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURES	Fraunhofer IESE Series on Software and Systems Engineering		English	Article; Book Chapter								Here, we will offer guidance on how to get started with architecture evaluation and how to institutionalize it in one's own company. There are many good opportunities for doing a first and beneficial architecture evaluation-new development, modernization of a system, or selection of new technologies. We will share best practices regarding how to have a successful start and how this success can be sustained. Finally, we will look at more sophisticated architecture evaluation methods and how the discipline can be further improved with even more dedicated guidance or a higher degree of automation, for example by integrating repeated compliance checks into the build process.

J	Di Angelo, M; Salzer, G				Di Angelo, Monika; Salzer, Gernot			Identification of token contracts on Ethereum: standard compliance and beyond	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DATA SCIENCE AND ANALYTICS			English	Article; Early Access						EVM bytecode; Heuristic; Interface; Smart contracts; Token standards; Transaction data	SALES	Next to cryptocurrencies, tokens are a widespread application area of blockchains. Tokens are digital assets implemented as small programs on a blockchain. Being programmable makes them versatile and an innovative means for various purposes. Tokens can be used as investment, as a local currency in a decentralized application, or as a tool for building an ecosystem or a community. A high-level categorization of tokens differentiates between payment, security, and utility tokens. In most jurisdictions, security tokens are regulated, and hence, the distinction is of relevance. In this work, we discuss the identification of tokens on Ethereum, the most widely used token platform. The programs on Ethereum are called smart contracts, which-for the sake of interoperability-may provide standardized interfaces. In our approach, we evaluate the publicly available transaction data by first reconstructing interfaces in the low-level code of the smart contracts. Then, we not only check the compliance of a smart contract with an established interface standard for tokens, but also aim at identifying tokens that are not fully compliant. Thus, we discuss various heuristics for token identification in combination with possible definitions of a token. More specifically, we propose indicators for tokens and evaluate them on a large set of token and non-token contracts. Finally, we present first steps toward an automated classification of tokens regarding their purpose.

Designing blockchain-based applications a case study for imported product traceability	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE			English	Article						Blockchain; Smart contract; Adaptability; Software architecture		Blockchain technology enables decentralization as new forms of distributed software architectures, where components can reach agreements on the shared system states without trusting on a central integration point. Since blockchain is an emerging technology which is still at an early stage of development, there is limited experience on applying blockchain to real-world software applications. We applied blockchain application design approaches proposed in software architecture community in a real-world project called originChain, which is a blockchain-based traceability system that restructures the current system by replacing the central database with blockchain. In this paper, we share our experience of building originChain. By using blockchain and designing towards security, originChain provides transparent tamper-proof traceability data with high availability and enables automated regulatory-compliance checking and adaptation in product traceability scenarios. We also demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the software architecture of originChain. Based on our experience and analysis, we found that the structural design of smart contracts has large impact on the quality of the system. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

There is a clear, outstanding need for the ability for specified policy to control and track data as it flows throughout cloud infrastructure, to ensure that those responsible for data are meeting their obligations. This paper introduces Information Flow Audit, an approach for tracking information flows within cloud infrastructure. This builds upon CamFlow (Cambridge Flow Control Architecture), a prototype implementation of our model for data-centric security in PaaS clouds. CamFlow enforces Information Flow Control policy both intra-machine at the kernel-level, and inter-machine, on message exchange. Here we demonstrate how CamFlow can be extended to provide data-centric audit logs akin to provenance metadata in a format in which analyses can easily be automated through the use of standard graph processing tools. This allows detailed understanding of the overall system. Combining a continuously enforced data-centric security mechanism with meaningful audit empowers tenants and providers to both meet and demonstrate compliance with their data management obligations.

In this paper, the practical issues that emerge during common "peg-in-hole" assembly procedures are discussed. In particular, the use of passive Remote Center of Compliance (RCC) devices, capable of compensating the IR non-optimal performance in terms of repeatability, is investigated. The focus of the paper is the design and simulation of a flexure-based RCC that allows the prevention of jamming, due to possible positioning inaccuracies during peg insertion. The proposed RCC architecture comprises a set of flexural hinges, whose behavior is simulated via a CAE tool that provides built-in functions for modelling the motion of compliant members. For given friction coefficients of the contact surfaces, these numerical simulations allow to determine the maximum lateral and angular misalignments effectively manageable by the RCC device.

This tool utilizes fundamentals of the surface loading assessment method developed by Kiefner & Associates Inc. (KAI) for Canadian Energy Pipeline Association (CEPA), but incorporated many advanced functionalities to improve the accuracy, efficiency and transparency of the analysis. The new functions of the tool include the batch analysis, multiple angle analysis, generic/site-specific loading analysis, graphical display of stress distributions for refined assessment, user-defined impact factor and automated reporting for documentation of surface loading calculations. This tool also incorporated the improved numerical algorithm for longitudinal global bending stress considering the actual live load pressure distribution over a certain length of pipeline. The accuracy of the developed tool was validated by comparing it to the KAI tool. The improved algorithm for longitudinal global bending stress calculation reduces the conservatism of the longitudinal global bending stress compared to the original simplified method but does not sacrifice safety, which has been demonstrated by comparison with the experimental results. The new functionalities improved the business efficiency and maintains safety and regulatory compliance.

A robotic manipulator is used to build the tunnel supporting formwork, consisting of rings of steel segments. As the shield of the tunnel-boring machine advances, concrete is continuously injected in the space between the formwork and the surrounding soil. This technology requires a fully automated manipulator, since potential human errors may jeopardize the continuity of the tunneling process. Moreover, the environment is hazardous for human operators. The manipulator has a linked structure with seven degrees of freedom and it is equipped with a head that can clamp the formwork segment. To design and test the controller, a dynamic model of the manipulator and its environment was first developed. Then, a feedback-linearizing hybrid position-force controller was designed. The design was validated through simulation in Matlab/Simulink. Virtual reality visualization was used to demonstrate the compliance properties of the controlled system.

Health informatics tools to date are largely rules-based, static in knowledge-gathering capability, and are not well incorporated within standard clinical processes. We introduce a multivariate analysis tool, built at the user-client interface, directly from data extracted from thousands of EMRs, for automated decision making. The predictive algorithms created to date have been implemented in a variety of clinical scenarios, including ER triage of chest pain, selection of optimal diagnostic testing, and management of chronic illnesses. This technology has now been applied to prediction of patient compliance with scheduled appointments in a medical specialty clinic. Approximately 16% of scheduled VA patients do not show for their scheduled appointments for Gastroenterology clinic. This results in misallocation of provider resources and inefficiencies in health care delivery. The improvement in quality of care, patient outcomes and cost is potentially immense.

The goal of validation is to determine if the requirements are correct and complete, and validation is performed in the final system assessment phase. Nevertheless, the introduction of formal methods in model based engineering tends to blur the boundary between verification and validation, by allowing validation tasks to be performed early in the process, before the system has been fully designed and implemented. In particular, we consider recent work using constraint satisfaction techniques to perform formal verification and validation tasks at model level. The purpose of this article is twofold. First, we attempt to fit the existing methods and tools in a global design, verification and validation process. Second, we show that in addition to verification and validation, constraint based techniques can be used to automate part of the design activity itself, by synthesizing correct by construction and quantitatively optimal models from a specification.

Almudena			Towards a new open communication standard between homes and service robots, the DHCompliant case	ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS			English	Article						Home&Building automation; Interoperability; Service robot; UPnP; SysML; DHCompliant		The interoperability of service robots and digital home was a user demand from the past years. In response to that necessity, the researchers from the Infobotica Research Group, in cooperation with a group of companies and universities, have proposed a new open standard and architecture. It is composed of different virtual services, protocols as well as an open adapters' architecture, on top of the UPnP protocol stack. The proposed application protocols and the general architecture provide a communication environment for positioning devices, rules compliance checks, the collaboration between devices and managing energy efficiently. The different tools, adapters, and protocols, developed within the DHCompliant architecture, have defined a new level of application protocol that has allowed increased integration of those modules into home automation, improving their interoperability, and allowing the addition of new services to the same standard and commercial hardware.

Medication management systems with built-in scanning and label-printing functions that integrate with medication-dispensing cabinets have the potential to decrease medication administration errors by improving compliance with medication labeling. Whether these management systems will also improve periodic automatic replacement (PAR) inventory control and be accepted by users is unknown. We hypothesized that implementation of the Codonics Safe Label System(R), an automated labeling system (ALS), would increase compliance with labeling guidelines and improve PAR inventory control by decreasing medication discrepancies while maintaining user acceptability in the OR. Methods: We audited a cohort of anesthesia workstations and electronic anesthesia records for 2 months to compare dispensed and administered medications and establish a discrepancy baseline. We also observed a convenience sample of syringes to evaluate labeling compliance. Post-implementation of the ALS, we repeated the audit. Finally, an anonymous survey was distributed electronically to providers to assess user acceptability. Results: Pre-implementation the average daily medication discrepancy rate was 9.7%, decreasing to 6.1% post-implementation (chi(2)(1) = 43.9; P < .0001). Pre-implementation 330 of 696 syringes (47.4%) were either missing a label or labeling elements. After implementation, 100% of all syringes received a label with the complete required labeling information (P < .0001). All respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the system was easy to use, accurate, met their needs, printed labels quickly, improved safety and efficiency, and was recommendable. Conclusion: The ALS significantly increased the rate of best-practice-compliant medication labeling while reducing medication inventory discrepancies. The system was highly accepted by providers.

Deep learning for site safety: Real-time detection of personal protective equipment	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Personal protective equipment (PPE); Construction safety; Deep learning; Transfer learning; Image dataset; Real-time object detection	CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; CONSTRUCTION; OBJECTS; MODEL	The leading causes of construction fatalities include traumatic brain injuries (resulted from fall and electrocution) and collisions (resulted from struck by objects). As a preventive step, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires that contractors enforce and monitor appropriate usage of personal protective equipment (PPE) of workers (e.g., hard hat and vest) at all times. This paper presents three deep learning (DL) models built on You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO) architecture to verify PPE compliance of workers; i.e., if a worker is wearing hard hat, vest, or both, from image/video in real-time. In the first approach, the algorithm detects workers, hats, and vests and then, a machine learning model (e.g., neural network and decision tree) verifies if each detected worker is properly wearing hat or vest. In the second approach, the algorithm simultaneously detects individual workers and verifies PPE compliance with a single convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. In the third approach, the algorithm first detects only the workers in the input image which are then cropped and classified by CNN-based classifiers (i.e., VGG-16, ResNet-50, and Xception) according to the presence of PPE attire. All models are trained on an in-house image dataset that is created using crowd-sourcing and web-mining. The dataset, named Pictor-v3, contains similar to 1,500 annotated images and similar to 4,700 instances of workers wearing various combinations of PPE components. It is found that the second approach achieves the best performance, i.e., 72.3% mean average precision (mAP), in real-world settings, and can process 11 frames per second (FPS) on a laptop computer which makes it suitable for real-time detection, as well as a good candidate for running on light-weight mobile devices. The closest alternative in terms of performance (67.93% mAP) is the third approach where VGG-16, ResNet-50, and Xception classifiers are assembled in a Bayesian framework. However, the first approach is the fastest among all and can process 13 FPS with 63.1% mAP. The crowed-sourced Pictor-v3 dataset and all trained models are publicly available to support the design and testing of other innovative applications for monitoring safety compliance, and advancing future research in automation in construction.

J	Dolgin, K				Dolgin, Kevin			The SPUR Model: A Framework for Considering Patient Behavior	PATIENT PREFERENCE AND ADHERENCE			English	Article						adherence; compliance; health beliefs; chronic diseases; review	MEDICATION ADHERENCE; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; EXTENDED SELF; NONADHERENCE; ACTIVATION; METAANALYSIS; ACCEPTANCE; PERCEPTION; DEPRESSION; PHYSICIAN	Background: Medication nonadherence is a global problem that requires urgent attention. Roughly half of all drugs that are prescribed for chronic treatments are not taken by the patients in question. Initiatives designed to support patients and help them modify their behavior are enhanced by personalization, and a number of profiling tools exist to help customize such interventions. Most of these tools were originally designed as paper-based questionnaires, but the growth of digital adherence technologies (DATs) illuminate the need for the development of digital profiling systems that can interact with fully automated patient interfaces. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine existing frameworks from medicine, psychology, sociology, consumer behavior, and economics to elaborate a comprehensive, quantitative profiling approach that can be used to drive the customization of patient support initiatives. Results: Building primarily on Icek Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the Health Belief Model (HBM) was used to inform the beliefs about behavior posited in the TPB, while incorporating established factors regarding self-efficacy in the "control" elements of the TPB and selected social and psychological factors in the other constituents of the model. The resulting SPUR (Social, Psychological, Usage, Rational) framework represents a holistic, profiling tool with detailed, quantitative outputs that describe a patient's behavioral risks and the drivers of that risk.

J	Koo, B; Jung, R; Yu, Y				Koo, Bonsang; Jung, Raekyu; Yu, Youngsu			Automatic classification of wall and door BIM element subtypes using 3D geometric deep neural networks	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Building information modeling; Industry foundation classes; Semantic integrity; Deep learning; Machine learning	SEMANTIC ENRICHMENT; BUILDING ELEMENTS	With the growing adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM), specialized applications have been developed to perform domain-specific analyses. These applications need tailored information with respect to a BIM model element's attributes and relationships. In particular, architectural elements need further qualification concerning their geometric and functional 'subtypes' to support exact simulations and compliance checks. BIM and its underlying data schema, the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), provide a rich representation with which to exchange semantic entity and relationship data. However, subtypes for individual elements are not represented by default and often require manual designation, leaving it vulnerable to errors and omissions. Existing research to enrich the semantics of IFC model entities employed domain-specific rule sets that scrutinize their legitimacy and modify them, if and when necessary. However, such an approach is limited in their scalability and comprehensibility. This study explored the use of 3D geometric deep neural networks originating from computer vision research. Specifically, Multi-view CNN(MVCNN) and PointNet were investigated to determine their applicability in extracting unique features of door (IfcDoor) and wall (IfcWall) element subtypes, and in turn be leveraged to automate subtype classifications. Test results indicated MVCNN as having the best prediction performance, while PointNet's accuracy was hampered by resolution loss due to selective use of point cloud data. The research confirmed deep neural networks as a viable solution to distinguishing BIM element subtypes, the critical factor being their ability to detect subtle differences in local geometries.

Topology optimization using polytopes	COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Density-based method; Virtual Element Method; Polyhedrons; Voronoi tessellation	FINITE-ELEMENTS; POLYGONAL ELEMENTS; MESH GENERATOR; CONSTRUCTION; DESIGN	Meshing complex engineering domains is a challenging task. Arbitrary polyhedral meshes can provide the much needed flexibility in automated discretization of such domains. The geometric property of polyhedral meshes such as its unstructured nature and the connectivity of faces between elements makes them specially attractive for topology optimization applications. Numerical anomalies in designs such as the single node connections and checkerboard pattern can be naturally circumvented with polyhedrons. In the current work, we solve the governing three-dimensional elasticity state equation using the Virtual Element Method (VEM) approach. The main characteristic difference between VEM and standard finite element methods (FEM) is that in VEM the canonical basis functions are not constructed explicitly. Rather the stiffness matrix is computed directly utilizing a projection map which extracts the linear component of the deformation. Such a construction guarantees the satisfaction of the patch test (used by engineers as an indicator of optimal convergence of numerical solutions under mesh refinement). Finally, the computations reduce to the evaluation of matrices which contain purely geometric surface facet quantities. The present work focuses on the first-order VEM in which the degrees of freedom are associated with the vertices. The features of the current optimization approach are demonstrated using numerical examples for compliance minimization and compliant mechanism problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The detection of the so called A and B-waves, and the analysis of subtle changes in C-waves, which are present in ICP waveform, may indicate decreased intracranial compliance, and may improve the clinical outcome. Despite the advances in the field of computerized data analysis, the visual screening of ICP continues to be the means principally employed to detect these waves. To the best of our knowledge, no review study has addressed automated ICP analysis in sufficient detail and a need to research the state of the art of ICP analysis has, therefore, been identified. Methodology This paper presents a systematic mapping study to provide answers to 7 research questions: publication time, venue and source trends, medical tasks undertaken, research methods used, computational systems developed, validation methodology, tools and systems employed for evaluation and research problems identified. An ICP software prototype is presented and evaluated as a consequence of the results. Results A total of 23 papers, published between 1990 and 2020, were selected from 6 online databases. After analyzing these papers, the following information was obtained: diagnosis and monitoring medical tasks were addressed to the same extent, and the main research method used was evaluation research. Several computational systems were identified in the papers, the main one being image classification, while the main analysis objective was single pulse analysis. Correlation with expert analysis was the most frequent validation method, and few of the papers stated the use of a published dataset. Few authors referred to the tools used to build or evaluate the proposed solutions. The most frequent research problem was the need for new analysis methods. These results have inspired us to propose a software prototype with which provide an automated solution that integrates ICP analysis and monitoring techniques. Conclusions The papers in this study were selected and classified with regard to ICP automated analysis methods. Several research gaps were identified, which the authors of this study have employed as a based on which to recommend future work. Furthermore, this study has identified the need for an empirical comparison between methods, which will require the use and development of certain standard metrics. An in-depth analysis conducted by means of systematic literature review is also required. The software prototype evaluation provided positive results, showing that the prototype may be a reliable system for A-wave detection. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

In the context of social networking sites, transitivity threats refer to potential privacy policy breaches that stem from the automated transmission of data/content due to user actions within the social network. For example, commenting on some content within the social network makes the commented content visible to the recipients of the comment, thereby breaching the privacy policy under which the original/commented content was shared. This paper presents a novel approach for modelling and comparing social network privacy policies to deal with transitivity threats. Our approach differs from existing approaches in its use of formal methods techniques to compare social network privacy policies. This work builds on a predicate calculus definition for social networking, modelling social network content, people, friendship relations, and privacy policies as access permissions to content. We have implemented our approach as a tool called Poporo. The tool extends on a previous version of the Poporo tool that checked a third party application's compliance with system invariants. We validate our approach by using Poporo on several examples.

We describe our methodology that comprises the application of highly automated processing and analysis methods to digital aerial photography. The approach described in this paper addresses a monitoring need by providing the ability to generate change information at a spatial resolution suitable for urban, peri-urban and coastal areas, where an increasing percentage of the worlds' population dwells. These areas are dynamic, with many environmental issues associated with planning, service provision, resource management and allocation, as well as monitoring regulatory compliance. We present a system based on standardised data and methods, which is able to track and communicate changes in features of interest in a way that has not been previously possible. We describe the methodology and then demonstrate its feasibility by applying it to geographic areas of planning and policy relevant size (the order of tens of thousands of square kilometres). We demonstrate the approach by applying it to the problem of urban forest assessment.

The design, construction and implementation of a computerised trauma registry in a developing South African metropolitan trauma service	INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED			English	Article						Trauma registry; Developing world; Human factors; Compliance		Introduction: The Pietermaritzburg Metropolitan Trauma Service formerly lacked a robust computerised trauma registry. This made surgical audit difficult for the purpose of quality of care improvement and development. We aimed to design, construct and implement a computerised trauma registry within our service. Twelve months following its implementation, we sought to examine and report on the quality of the registry. Methodology: Formal ethical approval to maintain a computerised trauma registry was obtained prior to undertaking any design and development. Appropriate commercial software was sourced to develop this project. The registry was designed as a flat file. A flat file is a plain text or mixed text and binary file which usually contains one record per line or physical record. Thereafter the registry file was launched onto a secure server. This provided the benefits of access security and automated backups. Registry training was provided to clients by the developer. The exercise of data capture was then integrated into the process of service delivery, taking place at the endpoint of patient care (discharge, transfer or death). Twelve months following its implementation, the compliance rates of data entry were measured. Results: The developer of this project managed to design, construct and implement an electronic trauma registry into the service. Twelve months following its implementation the data were extracted and audited to assess the quality. A total of 2640 patient entries were captured onto the registry. Compliance rates were in the order of eighty percent and client satisfaction rates were high. A number of deficits were identified. These included the omission of weekend discharges and underreporting of deaths. Conclusion: The construction and implementation of the computerised trauma registry was the beginning of an endeavour to continue improvements in the quality of care within our service. The registry provided a reliable audit at twelve months post implementation. Deficits and limitations were identified and new strategies have been planned to overcome these problems and integrate the trauma registry into the process of clinical care. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Resolving such errors early can prevent rework or the building of a system that is non-compliant with the client's intention. In developing complex systems and highly interactive systems, such as agent oriented systems, those errors in requirement analysis are even more likely. By focussing on the quality of interactions between the future users of the system and the human modellers, this article presents an innovative validation and verification process to support analysis of requirement analysis. We use domain knowledge to validate compliance with the client's intention. Using layered abstractions, we formulate the validation process which is methodology independent. An interactive support tool is implemented to support the developers using the requirement analysis process. The process is conducted iteratively to accommodate the lifecycle defined by most methodologies. The process and the tool are validated and illustrated using two different development exemplars illustrating different domains and different development methodologies.

The initial response of the pharmacy profession to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) chapter 797 and the current state of hospital pharmacy practice as it relates to implementing this chapter were studied. Methods. A stratified random sample of 600 hospital pharmacy directors across the nation were surveyed by mail. Results. A total of 251 surveys (41.8%) were returned. Larger hospitals (>= 200 staffed beds) were more likely than smaller hospitals (<200 staffed beds) to have read USP chapter 797 (80.0% versus 45.8%, respectively) and have a copy of the chapter (94.6% versus 78.0%, respectively). Overall, respondents felt that chapter 797 would negatively affect workload and pharmacy's ability to provide sterile preparations in a timely manner. Conversely, respondents replied that the new standard would have a positive effect on the quality of care provided by the hospital. Overall, 45.3% of respondents reported plans to build a cleanroom, and 21.7% reported plans to obtain new equipment to comply with chapter 797. Furthermore, 42.3% of respondents had decreased the quantity of high-risk compounding. Respondents also reported that their pharmacy's budget had in creased in order to comply with chapter 797. The most common requirements with which respondents were not willing to comply were validating the accuracy of automated compounding devices, sterilizing products and equipment before entering the cleanroom, rotating the type of disinfectants, and prohibiting use of cosmetics by staff. Conclusion. USP chapter 797 standards have influenced the compounding practices of hospital pharmacies nationwide, including a decrease in the compounding of high-risk preparations, an increase in budgetary allocations, and implementation of better quality assurance practices. Larger hospitals tended to implement more changes than did smaller hospitals, and there remains room for improvement overall.

This proposal also analyzes the capability of the KNX home and building automation standard to meet deterministic access. The paper proposes a solution to give deterministic bus access to the KNX devices. The proposal is based on the Master/Slave configuration network. In this configuration only one node, called Master, manage all the available bandwidth between the other devices, called Slaves. The Master accepts the entire real-time communication requirement from the slaves and once it knows them can start its internal scheduling algorithm in order to distribute the available bandwidth to the slaves. A key point of the proposed approach is that it's full compliance with the KNX standard.

J	Betaille, D; Peyret, F; Ifsttar; Voyer, M				Betaille, David; Peyret, Francois; Ifsttar; Voyer, Maxime			Applying Standard Digital Map Data in Map-aided, Lane-level GNSS Location	JOURNAL OF NAVIGATION			English	Article						GNSS; Multipath; 3D City Model; Standard Map Data		Urban positioning using the Global Positioning System (GPS) is challenging because of multipath. Urban canyons limit open sky visibility, and cause signal reflection and diffraction, resulting in significant satellite range measurement errors. The investigations reported here have been carried out in a French project called Inturb (an acronym derived from integrity and urban positioning). So far, the project has had two phases: first, a simple Three-Dimensional (3D) geometrical city modelling, called Urban Trench, has been developed and engineered manually from data sets collected in different cities. Positioning improvement in terms of accuracy was quantified where the model could be applied. Second, this modelling has been automated, based on the standard national BD Topo (R) map database for France, with promising results. This geometrical modelling makes it possible to distinguish between line-of-sight satellite signals and those from non-line-of-sight. The latter, apparently bona fide, signals are caused by strong reflections, usually from buildings with a lot of steel and glass in their construction. A correction of the pseudo-range measurements of the latter is also computed and applied in the position estimator. Positioning accuracy is improved, whilst availability is kept at its maximum. In the study both manual and automatic 3D models are used in extensive experimental campaigns. Results are: first, the possibility to cover entirely any urban area in the country; second, the reduction of the median error in 3D by more than 50% on data collected in Nantes, Paris and Toulouse for a total duration of nearly ten hours; third, the compliance with standards used in most embedded maps and geographical information systems, including an assessment of the trade-off between the model simplicity and the positioning improvement.

J	Chen, TY; Tsai, MC; Chen, YM				Chen, Tsung-Yi; Tsai, Meng-Che; Chen, Yuh-Min			A user's personality prediction approach by mining network interaction behaviors on Facebook	ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW			English	Article						Facebook; Social media; DISC theory; Interaction feature; Personality predicting	SELF-PRESENTATION; SOCIAL MEDIA; MOTIVATIONS; REFLECT	Purpose - For an enterprise, it is essential to win as many customers as possible. The key to successfully winning customers is often determined by understanding the personality characteristics of the object of communication in order to employ an effective communication strategy. An enterprise needs to obtain the personality information of target or potential customers. However, the traditional method for personality evaluation is extremely costly in terms of time and labor, and it cannot acquire customer personality information without their awareness. Therefore, the manner in which to effectively conduct automated personality predictions for a large number of objects is an important issue. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The diverse social media that have emerged in recent years represent a digital platform on which users can publicly deliver speeches and interact with others. Thus, social media may be able to serve the needs of automated personality predictions. Based on user data of Facebook, the main social media platform around the world, this research developed a method for predicting personality types based on interaction logs. Findings - Experimental results show that the Naive Bayes classification algorithm combined with a feature selection algorithm produces the best performance for predicting personality types, with 70-80 percent accuracy. Research limitations/implications -In this research, the dominance, inducement, submission, and compliance (DISC) theory was used to determine personality types. Some specific limitations were encountered. As Facebook was used as the main data source, it was necessary to obtain related data via Facebook's API (FB API). However, the data types accessible via FB API are very limited. Practical implications - This research serves to build a universal model for social media interaction, and can be used to propose an efficient method for designing interaction features. Originality/value - This research has developed an approach for automatically predicting the personality types of network users based on their Facebook interactions.

The system was also able to calculate an optimized schedule for the appliances to reduce energy cost in terms of time of use (TOU) tariffs. The sensor node and sink node has been developed in compliance with IEEE1451.2 and IEEE802.15.4 standards. And also the current and voltage sensors were also designed from first principals. The Zigbee series II RF transceivers employing the Zigbee communication protocol was used for communication and forming of the wireless sensor network. We have created a user interface able to display real time and historic energy consumption of appliances from IEEE1451.1 standard. We have created an optimization algorithm which scheduled appliance operation times within user set allowable operation times according to TOU tariffs.

By using the term "IT-readiness" we mean the ability of the enterprise to reach the mission by the most effective use of modern information technologies. There are contradictions between the need of the enterprise operatively to reconstruct design and production structures accordingly to the market condition change and the level of the modern IT use for maintenance of science intensive samples creation projects. The problem situation becomes complicated because of the lack of possibility of the fast development of expensive information support systems through the absence of big financial resources for the machine building enterprises in the conditions of an unstable investment climate and a low level of profitability. It leads to the need of the stage-by-stage IT introduction in the course of a life cycle support of a new equipment creation project that is also a characteristic for the machine building enterprises. It turned out that the high technology development is carried out now under the conditions of essential restrictions of financial resources all around the world. In these conditions one of progressive ideologies is Lean Manufacturing methodology. World experience shows that the success of this ideology introduction is directly connected with an effective use of modern information technologies of the high technology samples design and business management. Thus, an important question is the compliance of the enterprise to the necessary level of IT-readiness which is directly connected with a technological maturity.

Developments in silicone rubber extrusion technology made it possible to build a perfused manometric system, using a perfused manometric assembly requiring a low volume of perfusate. In the present study the feasibility of recording and automated analysis of small intestinal motility using a perfused multiple lumen manometric system was evaluated in seven healthy volunteers. Pressures were recorded from 12 sideholes arranged in lour clusters spaced at 10-cm intervals from the catheter tip. Each channel was perfused at 0.15 mL min(-1) with degassed water by a portable, low-compliance, perfusion pump. The 12 sidehole recording channels were connected to external transducers mounted on a belt. Pressure data were stored in two dataloggers. Motility was recorded in the sitting (30 min), and supine (30 min) position, during walking (30 min) and postprandially (90 min). Using purpose-built software baseline variations were corrected for and manometric variables (number of pressure waves, mean amplitude and motility index) calculated. Bench testing of the manometric assembly showed a median baseline pressure offset of 4.2 kPa (range 3.7-10.1) and upon occlusion a rise rate of 27.8 kPa sec(-1) (range 19.7-30.8). Changes in body position affected baseline pressures so that compared to the supine position changes in baseline pressure varied between 1.5 +/- 0.7 kPa and 1.9 +/- 0.6 kPa during sitting (P < 0.02), and between 1.7 +/- 0.7 kPa and 1.5 +/- 0.9 kPa during walking (P < 0.03). Manometric recordings obtained during the fasting period showed an increase in small intestinal motor activity during walking. In the postprandial period no differences in motility variables were observed within one cluster and in time. Recording of small intestinal motility with a multiple-channel silicone rubber manometric assembly with a portable perfusion system is a feasible technique which is relatively inexpensive. Computer-assisted data processing allows for adequate elimination of artefacts and automated numerical analysis.

Remote PMU Testing using Low-cost FPGA Platform and PPA following IEEE TSS	2019 IEEE INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS SOCIETY ANNUAL MEETING	IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting		English	Proceedings Paper	54th Annual Meeting of the IEEE-Industry-Applications-Society (IEEE IAS)	SEP 28-OCT 03, 2019	Baltimore, MD	IEEE Ind Applicat Soc		PMU; FPGA Platform; NI-cRIO; PMU Calibration; IEEE TSS; End-to-End Remote Compliance Test		Enhanced automation and control requires advanced sensors in the smart electric power grid. Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) is one of the sensors with the fastest streaming data enabling advanced automation and control algorithms in the electric grid. After PMUs are initially tested, installed, and brought into service in the field, there are no established procedure for in-field calibration testing following the IEEE Synchrophasor Measurement Test Suite Specification (TSS). Hence, in-field remote testing of PMU is necessary to guarantee that PMU performs accurately when needed and are not affected with any software/hardware error that develops with time or hidden failure that was not captured before commissioning. This paper proposes a feasible architecture for in-field remote PMU testing using an FPGA platform and PPA software platform, as well as presents an architecture and accuracy requirement of a typical PMU calibrator. An algorithm implemented in the FPGA platform using a low-cost National Instrument compact RIO (NI-cRIO) is also proposed in this paper. The generated signal using the proposed method is demonstrated to be suitable for PMU static test cases. The accuracy of the proposed method and the in-built signal generation module of NI-cRIO is compared based on the frequency uncertainty and total harmonic distortion. The compliance results of a sample PMU for static test cases using the proposed method is also presented in this paper.

Several of the largest bankruptcies in U.S. history involved firms that engaged in major fraud. Accordingly, there has been considerable emphasis on the development of automated approaches for detecting financial fraud. However, most methods have yielded performance results that are less than ideal. In consequence, financial fraud detection continues as an important challenge for business intelligence technologies. In light of the need for more robust identification methods, we use a design science approach to develop MetaFraud, a novel meta-learning framework for enhanced financial fraud detection. To evaluate the proposed framework, a series of experiments are conducted on a test bed encompassing thousands of legitimate and fraudulent firms. The results reveal that each component of the framework significantly contributes to its overall effectiveness. Additional experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the meta-learning framework over state-of-the-art financial fraud detection methods. Moreover, the MetaFraud framework generates confidence scores associated with each prediction that can facilitate unprecedented financial fraud detection performance and serve as a useful decision-making aid The results have important implications for several stakeholder groups, including compliance officers, investors, audit firms, and regulators.

J	Lacroix, B; Mathieu, P; Kemeny, A				Lacroix, Benoit; Mathieu, Philippe; Kemeny, Andras			Formalizing the construction of populations in multi-agent simulations	ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Agent; Agent-based simulation; Behavior; Variety; Consistency; Road traffic	MODEL	In individual-centered simulations, the variety and consistency of agents' behaviors reinforce the realism and validity of the simulation. Variety increases the diversity of behaviors that users meet during the simulation. Consistency ensures that these behaviors improve the users' feeling of immersion. In this work, we address the issue of the simultaneous influence of these two elements. We propose a formalization of the construction of populations for agent-based simulations, which provides the basis for a generic and non-intrusive tool allowing an out-of-the-agent design. First, the model uses behavioral patterns to describe standards of behaviors for the agents. They provide a behavioral archetype during agents' creation, and are also a compliance reference, that allows to detect deviant behaviors and address them. Then, a specific process instantiates the agents by using the specification provided by the patterns. Finally, inference enables to automate behavioral patterns configuration from real or simulated data. This formalization allows for the easy introduction of variety in agents' behaviors, while controlling the conformity to specifications. We applied the model to traffic simulation, in order to introduce driving styles specified using behavioral patterns (e.g. cautious or aggressive drivers). The behavioral realism of the traffic was therefore improved, and the experimentations we conducted show how the model contributes to increase the variety and the representativeness of the behaviors.

This paper develops a 4 degree of freedom (4-DOF) selective compliance assembly robot arm (SCARA) robot with three rotary joints and one prismatic joint (3RIP) to realize pick-and-place tasks of the circular and rectangular workpieces. The structure of the robot is firstly presented. The kinematic model is then built, and the kinematic analysis is performed based on MA TLAB. The trajectory planning is further implemented. A control interface is also designed via Visual C++ to control the robot for achieving pick-and-place tasks. The validity of the developed robot is finally verified through experimental results.

Implementation of ETIS solves the most complex tasks associated with the educational process. In particular ETIS allows: building a unified information environment within the educational process, standardization and regulation of internal processes, formalization and transparent management of the university organizational structure, automation of teaching and methodical management of universities, the organization of electronic workflow as well as many other tasks. This can include, for example, effective processing of multi-faceted scientific information of different types (publications, experimental data, reports, organizations, conferences, etc.). We attempt to employ Semantic Web technologies to integrate the huge amount of eLearning resources and the growing information, coming from the Internet and various distributed and local sources, with the resources of ETIS in order to provide a unified semantic search of relevant information for single and group users (e. g. instructors, courseware authors and learners). Applying an ontological engineering method to the learning content and an education methodical complexes design will automate the instructor's work. It will help to estimate the quality and to define the completeness of methodical complexes, to compare and to monitor their compliance with government education standards. The presented intelligent tools are still under development, but some improvements have already been achieved. Using metadata and an ontological approach to learning and methodical content development is shown to enable new opportunities in eLearning such as an automatic generation of group/individual educational trajectories and support of the "cognition through construction" method. Within context of this method a student does not simply use information resources and software, but also produces both of them during the learning process. We demonstrate an eLearning system based on application domain ontologies for artificial neural network (ANN) learning and teaching. This subject was chosen for demonstration, because students learn it through a lot of practical experiments and there is a need to develop special tools to support ANN self-learning. After the ANN ontology description demonstration, we present our implementation strategy that is based on the Topic Maps paradigm, an ISO standard. The proposed strategy contributes to quick subject understanding, simplifies the assessment process and makes the exchange of knowledge and experience easier.

J	Becker, K; Pedroso, BDC; Pimenta, MS; Jacobi, RP				Becker, Karin; Costa Pedroso, Bruno de Souza; Pimenta, Marcelo Soares; Jacobi, Ricardo Pezzuol			Besouro: A framework for exploring compliance rules in automatic TDD behavior assessment	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						TDD; Conformance assessment; Framework	TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT; SOFTWARE-DEVELOPMENT; EXPERIENCE	Context: The improvements promoted by Test-Driven Design (TDD) have not been confirmed by quantitative assessment studies. To a great extent, the problem lies in the lack of a rigorous definition for TDD. An emerging approach has been to measure the conformance of TDD practices with the support of automated systems that embed an operational definition, which represent the specific TDD process assumed and the validation tests used to determine its presence and quantity. The empirical construction of TDD understanding and consensus building requires the ability of comparing different definitions, evaluating them with regard to practitioners' perception, and exploring code information for improvement of automatic assessment. Objective: This paper describes Besouro, a framework targeted at the development of systems for automatic TDD behavior assessment. The main rationale of Besouro's design is the ability to compare distinct operational definitions, evaluate them with regard to users' perception, and explore code information for further analysis and conformance assessment improvement. Method: We developed an architecture with clear separation of concerns, which enables to vary: (a) the atomic events and respective metrics to be collected from developing and testing environments; (b) the organization of atomic events in streams of actions or processes; and (c) the classification and assessment components for each set of operational definitions adopted. The architecture also includes a mechanism for on-line user assessment awareness and feedback, and integrates event-related information with the respective code in a code version system. Results: We illustrate the usefulness of Besouro's features for understanding the actions and processes underlying TDD through a prototype developed to support an experiment based on user feedback. We show how it was possible to compare variations of a same operational definition by exploring users' feedback, and use source code to improve the automatic classification of TDD practices. Conclusion: Understanding the actions and processes underlying successful TDD application is key for leveraging TDD benefits. In the absence of a rigorous definition for TDD, the proposed approach aims at building consensus from experimentation and empirical validation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results were then critiqued. Methods of storing data and using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) were studied. These results were used as an aid for developing a prototype system for monitoring medication dosages in a home health care environment. The combination of an RFID technology - the Intel Wireless Sensor Platform (WISPs) and the construction of a specific pill dispensing container in this prototype demonstrated that it is possible to use RFID technology to effectively and ubiquitously monitor and track drug taking compliance. With further refinements on the dispensing unit and optimization of the software this product could be manufactured and released to home care patients to help increase compliance and reduce health related issues. This could form the heart of a modular telecare data collection system. RFID-based devices that can store data in standardized formats may allow incremental development of home telecare systems in an economical fashion.

A feedforward neural network for drone accident prediction from physiological signals	SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT			English	Article; Early Access						Physiological signal; Deep learning; Feedforward neural network; Accident prediction; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Construction safety	MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES; ACTIVITY RECOGNITION; MULTILAYER PERCEPTRON; HEART-RATE; CONSTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE; MODELS; SENSOR	Purpose As drones are rapidly transforming tasks such as mapping and surveying, safety inspection and progress monitoring, human operators continue to play a critical role in ensuring safe drone missions in compliance with safety regulations and standard operating procedures. Research shows that operator's stress and fatigue are leading causes of drone accidents. Building upon the authors' past work, this study presents a systematic approach to predicting impending drone accidents using data that capture the drone operator's physiological state preceding the accident. Design/methodology/approach The authors collect physiological data from 25 participants in real-world and virtual reality flight experiments to design a feedforward neural network (FNN) with back propagation. Four time series signals, namely electrodermal activity (EDA), skin temperature (ST), electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart rate (HR), are selected, filtered for noise and used to extract 92 time- and frequency-domain features. The FNN is trained with data from a window of length t = 3 horizontal ellipsis 8 s to predict accidents in the next p = 3 horizontal ellipsis 8 s. Findings Analysis of model performance in all 36 combinations of analysis window (t) and prediction horizon (p) combinations reveals that the FNN trained with 8 s of physiological signal (i.e. t = 8) to predict drone accidents in the next 6 s (i.e. p = 6) achieved the highest F1-score of 0.81 and AP of 0.71 after feature selection and data balancing. Originality/value The safety and integrity of collaborative human-machine systems (e.g. remotely operated drones) rely on not only the attributes of the human operator or the machinery but also how one perceives the other and adopts to the evolving nature of the operational environment. This study is a first systematic attempt at objective prediction of potential drone accident events from operator's physiological data in (near-) real time. Findings will lay the foundation for creating automated intervention systems for drone operations, ultimately leading to safer jobsites.

The system was designed for and implemented in a factory creating super abrasive diamond tools. In that technology, the operational parameters compliance is a very important condition for quality production and its economy. An impact of the human factor on production and its quality represents the main problem. These experiences and the technology requirements lead to a new system development. The hardware and software modules are based on the client-server model on a PC platform. This sophistically designed and developed system allows many functions for the management support.

J	Chau, KW; Albermani, F				Chau, KW; Albermani, F			A coupled knowledge-based expert system for design of liquid-retaining structures	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						coupled knowledge-based expert system; design; liquid-retaining structures	FLOW	This paper describes a coupled knowledge-based system (KBS) for the design of liquid-retaining structures, which can handle both the symbolic knowledge processing based on engineering heuristics in the preliminary synthesis stage and the extensive numerical crunching involved in the detailed analysis stage. The prototype system is developed by employing blackboard architecture and a commercial shell VISUAL RULE STUDIO. Its present scope covers design of three types of liquid-retaining structures, namely, a rectangular shape with one compartment, a rectangular shape with two compartments and a circular shape. Through custom-built interactive graphical user interfaces, the user is directed throughout the design process, which includes preliminary design, load specification, model generation, finite element analysis, code compliance checking and member sizing optimization. It is also integrated with various relational databases that provide the system with sectional properties, moment and shear coefficients and final member details. This system can act as a consultant to assist novice designers in the design of liquid-retaining structures with increase in efficiency and optimization of design output and automated record keeping. The design of a typical example of the liquid-retaining structure is also illustrated. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

Conceptually, a blockchain ( BC) is defined as a decentralized ledger that registers every transactional operation made in encrypted data format. The implementation of such concept bring about augmented security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in the work environment dynamics from the current centralized structure to a decentralized, cooperative chain of transactions by encouraging trust and transparency. This paper presents an overview of BC technology and its applications in the AEC industry and its potential integration with the building information ( BIM) process. Furthermore, the study explores how BC technologies can improve the BIM working environment by reinforcing network security, providing more reliable data storage and management of permissions, ensuring change tracing and data ownership. The paper discusses the fundamental principles of distributed ledgers, their current applications and potential future advances, and their classification based on inherent characteristics of consensus reaching and permission management. The study presents some examples the prospective application of BC technologies in enhancing the framework for automating the code compliance checking process such as smart contract technologies and Hyperledger Fabric, as well as discussing the pros, cons, possible directions, and future research directions.

J	Hull, PV; Canfield, S				Hull, PV; Canfield, S			Optimal synthesis of compliant mechanisms using subdivision and commercial FEA	JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN			English	Article							SHAPE OPTIMIZATION; DESIGN; SURFACES	The field of distributed-compliance mechanisms has seen significant work in developing suitable topology optimization tools,for their design. These optimal design tools have grown out of the techniques of structural optimization. This paper will build oil the previous work in topology optimization and compliant mechanism design by proposing an alternative design space parametrization through control points and adding another step to the process, that of subdivision. The control points allow a specific design to be represented as a solid model during the optimization process. The process of subdivision creates an additional number of control points that help smooth the surface (for example a C-2 continuous surface depending on the method of subdivision chosen) creating a manifacturable design free of some traditional numerical instabilities. Note that these additional control points do not add to the number of design parameters. This alternative parametrization and description as a solid model effectively and completely separates the design variables from the analysis variables during the optimization procedure. The motivation behind this work is to create an automated design tool from task definition to functional prototype created on a CNC or rapid-prototype machine. This paper will describe the proposed compliant mechanism design process and will demonstrate the procedure on several examples common in the literature.

These hyper-giants operate highly distributed infrastructures to cope with the ever-increasing demand for online content. To achieve commercial-grade performance of Web applications, enhanced end-user experience, improved reliability, and scaled network capacity, hyper-giants are increasingly interconnecting with eyeball networks at multiple locations. This poses new challenges for both (1) the eyeball networks having to perform complex inbound traffic engineering, and (2) hyper-giants having to map end-user requests to appropriate servers. We report on our multi-year experience in designing, building, rolling-out, and operating the first-ever large scale system, the Flow Director, which enables automated cooperation between one of the largest eyeball networks and a leading hyper-giant. We use empirical data collected at the eyeball network to evaluate its impact over two years of operation. We find very high compliance of the hyper-giant to the Flow Director's recommendations, resulting in (1) close to optimal user-server mapping, and (2) 15% reduction of the hyper-giant's traffic overhead on the ISP's long-haul links, i.e., benefits for both parties and end-users alike.

The acquisition of detailed and reliable information, especially about the behaviour of weld joints exposed to high temperatures and pressure during long-term operation is of vital importance. Examined heterogeneous and homogeneous weld joints were made from austenitic heat resistant steels HR3C, SUPER 304H and Tp347HFG and also from martensitic steel P92. In order to ensure optimal and reproducible welding conditions, it was necessary to set the parameters of automated orbital GTAW welding, including thermal regime during welding - preheating, interpass and reheating temperatures as well as postweld heat treatment (PWHT). Information about the properties and behaviour of the welds were obtained by testing (WPQR) made in compliance with standard EN 15614-1. The presented work thus builds on the results of previous activities published last year and now it presents the results of welds and tests performed on heterogeneous weld joint of steels Tp347 HFG and Super 304H. Besides the principal results it shows also the results of additional testing of materials made after different regime of PWHT. Moreover, we present the preliminary results of long-term creep tests, which are still continuing.

According to these regulations, the Informed Consent (IC) is an inevitable element of research with human subjects. In the era of "big data medicine", aspects of IC become even more relevant since research becomes more complex rendering compliance with legal and ethical regulations increasingly difficult. Methods Based on literature research and practical experiences gathered by the Institute for Community Medicine (ICM), University Medicine Greifswald, requirements for digital consent management systems were identified. Results To address the requirements, the free-of-charge, open-source software "generic Informed Consent Service" (gICS(R)) was developed by ICM to provide a tool to facilitate and enhance usage of digital ICs for the international research community covering various scenarios. gICS facilitates IC management based on IC modularisation and supports various workflows within research, including (1) electronic depiction of paper-based consents and (2) fully electronic consents. Numerous projects applied gICS and documented over 336,000 ICs and 2400 withdrawals since 2014. Discussion Since the consent's content is a prerequisite for securing participants' rights, application of gICS is no guarantee for legal compliance. However, gICS supports fine-granular consents and accommodation of differentiated consent states, which can be directly exchanged between systems, allowing automated data processing. Conclusion gICS simplifies and supports sustained IC management as a major key to successfully conduct studies and build trust in research with human subjects. Therefore, interested researchers are invited to use gICS and provide feedback for further improvements.

J	Narula, R				Narula, Rajneesh			Enforcing higher labor standards within developing country value chains: Consequences for MNEs and informal actors in a dual economy	JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES			English	Article						economic development in emerging markets; value chain; transaction cost theory; internalization theory; MNEs and economic development	GLOBAL VALUE CHAINS; MULTINATIONAL-ENTERPRISES; INTERNALIZATION THEORY; PRODUCTION NETWORKS; SUPPLY CHAINS; RESPONSIBILITY; GOVERNANCE; CHALLENGES; CLUSTERS; IMPACT	The 2013 collapse of the Rana Plaza building in Dhaka, Bangladesh, led external stakeholders to insist on higher labor standards in apparel global value chains (GVCs). Stakeholders now expect MNEs to take 'full-chain' responsibility. However, the increased monitoring and enforcement costs of a large network of suppliers have been non-trivial. MNEs instead implement a 'cascading compliance' approach, coupled with a partial re-internalization. Elevated costs are further exacerbated in developing countries where the informal and formal sectors are linked, and cost competitiveness greatly depends on this duality. Monitoring actors in the informal sector is difficult, and few informal actors can achieve compliance. GVCs have therefore reduced informal sector engagement by excluding non-compliant actors and investing in greater automation. By seeking to strictly enforce compliance, MNEs are attenuating some of the positive effects of MNE investment, particularly the prospects for employment creation (especially among women), and enterprise growth in the informal sector. I discuss how these observations might inform other cross-disciplinary work in development, ethics, and sociology.

It is very common that promising research approaches or PoC (proof of concepts) encounter difficulties when applied in industry solutions, due to specific industry requirements, bias or constraints. The paper is to show how industry business knowledge can be incorporated into machine learning algorithms to help eliminate bias, that might have been overlooked, and build industry domains cartridges models to be used in future solutions. The industry models are currently explored by businesses' that want to enhance their portfolios with cognitive and AI capabilities and learn from transaction-based insights. With this research we aim to show how best machine learning models can learn from industry expertise and business use cases to create re-usable domain cartridges which can stand as core for: Bots, RPA (Robotic Processing Automation), industry patters, data insights discovery, control and compliance.

J	Lasky, TA; Ravani, B				Lasky, TA; Ravani, B			Sensor-based path planning and motion control for a robotic system for roadway crack sealing	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						compliance control; construction industry; manipulator motion planning; mobile robot motion planning; morphological operations; redundant systems; road vehicles; robustness		This paper discusses a path planning and control method developed for robotic application in roadway crack sealing. Filling and scaling of roadway cracks is a tedious operation subject to poor working conditions. Application of autonomous robotics to this operation requires a path planning system that can take data representing roadway cracks from an external sensor, extract connected crack paths, and link paths together to form the Cartesian motion for the robotic system used to seal the crack. Since the operation is performed in an on-line fashion, the path planning system has to perform kinematic computations based on dead-reckoning data to update the crack profile as the crack sealing vehicle is moving. Stringent requirements are placed on the controller by the errors inherent in the global path generation, along with the fact that to avoid kinematic singularities, the manipulator used is kinematically redundant. The system developed uses a robust controller known as the simplified Cartesian computed torque (SCCT) to guide the end-effector along with a compliance loop to move the desired trajectory over the crack, while also addressing kinematic redundancy through application of the weighted generalized inverse Jacobian, The contributions of this paper are on developing practical applications of image processing techniques to extract path locations and determine the appropriate Cartesian end-effector paths, as well as the development of a simple but robust compliant redundant robot controller, all for use in the unstructured environment encountered in highway maintenance operations, The system described has been implemented as part of a prototype automated crack sealing machine. Sample results for actual highway data are included.

The study is essential for automating and performing subsequent statistical analysis of the process, so the logical, structural and functional models of the process have been obtained and studied. In the study, the authors used the deductive system (developed by them) of the process of choosing the best alternative. First of all, the network modelling method was applied, alongside with the graphic way of calculation and formulae for defining the early and late event occurrence term. It has been found that the optimal time implies one cognitive work on selecting the best alternative from many known ones proceeding from a certain volume of knowledge, which needs automating. Next, Kolmogorov equations for the choice process were generated, with data obtained and a graph built which allowed making some useful conclusions. Having only a half of the amount of knowledge in a subject area enables one to get a simple intelligent system repeating the critical path 1-2-3-4-5. A smaller volume of knowledge can be used for a learning intelligent system, and a greater volume - in an intelligent system featuring error correction and check for compliance with the expected result. Then, an intelligent system conducting exploratory research has to possess the total volume of knowledge in order to maximize its cognitive power up to lambda = 1, in which case the efficiency of this system will be comparable to that of the natural intelligence. This is why the authors looked for an approach which would be close to the natural intelligence in representing metaknowledge. The paper provides a specific representation of metaknowledge, with the decision tree being that of a multitude of precedents. All the rules are applied for obtaining the tree, in which a consequent is a corresponding antecedent, and the transition to it corresponds to the obtained tree structure. Such trees can be used for representing metaknowledge and searching for solutions while organizing the efficient choice process.

Synthesis of intellectual diagnostic models was produced a by using the Matlab graphical agents. At the same time, there were synthesized models of three types: fuzzy, neural-network and model built by planning the full factorial experimental method. Was proposed the concept of the three-stage procedure of the diagnosis of the thermal power station's turbine unit, instead of the creation of diagnosis mathematical models and failure models of objects, immediately begin to develop an algorithm of diagnosis using advanced intelligent technologies. The technique of creating a sub-line diagnostics status of the turbine unit, which includes three main stages: identification of diagnostic features based on expert method; the synthesis of diagnostic model of the facility technical condition; research models on the stability, sensitivity and uniqueness, was proposed. The main diagnostic features of assessing the state of turbine equipment, which, in accordance with the concept developed, allow forming a matrix of planning a full factorial experiment. The proposed techniques and concepts were subjected to experimental verification. The intellectual diagnostic model of turbine unit equipment health was proposed, synthesized and investigated. It was found that the best model is the model, built using neuro-fuzzy algorithms. The simulation was provided for neuro-fuzzy algorithms and confirmed their effectiveness and compliance with the laws of the physical functioning of the HPC. The results of this research have been used in the development of Almaty CHP-2 turbine equipment health management subsystems, allow the further development of the theoretical foundations of intellectual systems, and demonstrate the possibility of using modern concepts to solve important technical problems. Subsystem of operative diagnosis and the following software implementation in a complex of automated technological process of thermal power control system allows one to make an early diagnosis of the equipment health. This significantly reduces the maintenance costs, improves reliability and security, as well as the effectiveness of the control system.

At the same time, legislation in the European Union has been adopted in the same direction (e.g., PSD2) in order to impose obligations on stakeholders to identify fraud. However, on the one hand, the legislation provides a high-level description of this legal obligation, and on the other hand, the solutions in the market are diversifying in terms of data collected and, especially, attempts to aggregate data in order to generate more accurate results. This leads to an issue that has not been analyzed yet deeply in specialty literature or by legislators, respectively, the privacy concerns in case of profile building and aggregation of data for fraud identification purposes and responsibility of stakeholders in the identification of frauds in the context of their obligations under data protection legislation. This article comes as a building block in this direction of research, as it contains (i) an analysis of existing fraud detection methods and approaches, together with their impact from a data protection legislation perspective and (ii) an analysis of respondents' views toward privacy in case of fraud identification in transactions based on a questionnaire in this respect having 425 respondents. Consequently, this article assists in bridging the gap between data protection legislation and implementation of fraud detection obligations under the law, as it provides recommendations for compliance with the latter legal obligation while also complying with data protection aspects.

This community was multidisciplinary in nature and therefore needed a range of facilities for searching. Of particular importance were facilities to help those unfamiliar with specialist terminology. To meet these needs, four applications were designed and developed: a Metadata Capture Tool for describing datasets in compliance with the National Geospatial Data Framework (NGDF) standard, a Term Entry Tool for creating an ISO compliant thesaurus, a Thesaurus Builder for merging thesauri and a Search Tool. To encourage users to help in cataloguing data, the capture tools were written as stand alone applications, which users could keep and use to build their own metadatabases. The tools contained export and import facilities that allowed the URGENT Data Centre to build a central database and publish it upon the web. During the development work, it was found necessary to extend the NGDF standard as it could not adequately describe time variant or 3-D atmospheric datasets. The four applications met their design objectives. However, a number of ergonomic issues will need to be addressed if the system is to meet the needs of the much larger up coming programmes. The main challenges will be moving from the NGDF standard to the ISO standard, hence bringing the work into line with the recommendations of the INSPIRE Project, and merging the metadatabase with the scientific database, which enable metadata maintenance to be semi-automated.

This is even more important when applying a machine to replace a failing organ, as is the case for home ventilation. Even if modern home ventilators fulfil quality and safety criteria and, 'on paper', ventilators and masks look very similar, performance and scenarios of applicability are not always equivalent. In the case of ventilators, the type of circuit, accessories provided and available modes vary between devices. Bench studies comparing ventilators have shown large differences in triggering, rise time, pressurisation capacities, maximal flow provided, cycling and level of authorised expiratory positive airway pressure. Automated algorithms to deal with leaks also vary and have not been sufficiently evaluated. In the case of interfaces, the choice of mask requires careful evaluation of the underlying disease and of the type of ventilator and circuit, which could have a potentially major impact on patient compliance and clinical effectiveness.

The choice of ventilator and type of mask represents a medical prescription and should be respected by the provider and not subject to financial constraints.

Many of these scenarios, e.g., home automation, require tools beyond data visualizations, to express user intents and to ensure interactions do not cause undesired effects in the physical world. We present SIFT, a safety-centric programming platform for connected devices in IoT environments. First, to simplify programming, users express high-level intents in declarative IoT apps. The system then decides which sensor data and operations should be combined to satisfy the user requirements. Second, to ensure safety and compliance, the system verifies whether conflicts or policy violations can occur within or between apps. Through an office deployment, user studies, and trace analysis using a large-scale dataset from a commercial IoT app authoring platform, we demonstrate the power of SIFT and highlight how it leads to more robust and reliable IoT apps.

The implementation will cove so many areas like Human Capital Management, Regulatory Compliance, Management Excellence Objectives, Process Evaluation and Continuous Improvement, Project, Budget and Performance Tracking. The implementation strategy will start by creating an action plan for the roles and regulation then build Corporate, Division, Group, Strategic, Section and Team Plans, then get your plan into everyone's todo list, finally monitor your Plan's Progress by reviewing the automatically updated charts of progress as people contribute and complete actions and tasks, and review results and outcomes and build optimized templates to reuse in the future. The use of strategy management planning and executing software not just to follow up planning execution but to get full visibility into strategy plan and portfolio status, and to choose the right work to do in the first place. This helps you achieve the full value of plan portfolio management. Mainly the problem in any management strategy plan execution lack visibility into what Leaders and teams are doing, making it difficult to make informed decisions, by automated the action we get real-time visibility into what people are working on, when that work will be done, and how things are really going. Steps to lead your plan your team, your organization to success, first Action Plan Template on Paper, then Breakdown large Strategic Plans into separate Action Plans, then Create a ToDo list from relevant actions, finally Updating and timely Feedback.			m-mostafa@ascon-me.com; emadeid1973@hotmail.com					Abu Ali A., 2009, EUROPEAN J SCI RES, V35, P188; Al-Oman A., 2006, J COMPUTER SCI, V2, P841, DOI DOI 10.3844/JCSSP.2006.841.845; Gilbert D., 2004, INT J PUBLIC SECTOR, V17, P286, DOI DOI 10.1108/09513550410539794; SCHWARE R, 2004, SEM E GOV SUCC PIL S	4	0	0	0	3	EDITURA UNIVERSITARA	BUCHAREST	BD NICOLAE BALCESCU NO 27-33, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA	2066-026X			ELEARN SOFTW EDUC			2012							434	439		10.5682/2066-026X-12-161			6	Education & Educational Research	Education & Educational Research	BEI53	WOS:000316711900070					2022-01-06

A one-piece 3D printed flexure translation stage for open-source microscopy	REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	16th International Conference on Ion Sources (ICIS)	AUG 23-28, 2015	New York, NY	Brookhaven Natl Lab, Collider Accelerator Dept			OPTICAL TWEEZERS; HINGES; INTENSITY; DIAGNOSIS; LENSES	Open source hardware has the potential to revolutionise the way we build scientific instruments; with the advent of readily available 3D printers, mechanical designs can now be shared, improved, and replicated faster and more easily than ever before. However, printed parts are typically plastic and often perform poorly compared to traditionally machined mechanisms. We have overcome many of the limitations of 3D printed mechanisms by exploiting the compliance of the plastic to produce a monolithic 3D printed flexure translation stage, capable of sub-micron-scale motion over a range of 8 x 8 x 4 mm. This requires minimal post-print clean-up and can be automated with readily available stepper motors. The resulting plastic composite structure is very stiff and exhibits remarkably low drift, moving less than 20 mu m over the course of a week, without temperature stabilisation. This enables us to construct a miniature microscope with excellent mechanical stability, perfect for time-lapse measurements in situ in an incubator or fume hood. The ease of manufacture lends itself to use in containment facilities where disposability is advantageous and to experiments requiring many microscopes in parallel. High performance mechanisms based on printed flexures need not be limited to microscopy, and we anticipate their use in other devices both within the laboratory and beyond. (C) 2016 Author(s).

An important aspect of this concept is the development and use of Digital Twins. A Digital Twin is a digital representation of a product or process that is used to optimize the design and use of said product or process. In this opinion article, we show that such Digital Twins have already been developed for a variety of tissue engineering processes. Using skeletal tissue engineering as a case study, we discuss a number of models at various stages of use between bench and bedside and ranging from pure data-driven models to models built on known mechanisms and first principles. Finally, we emphasize the importance of data collection and model validation to ensure, amongst others, compliance to regulatory guidelines.

J	Fornos, LB; Urbansky, KA; Villarreal, R				Fornos, Laura B.; Urbansky, Kathleen A.; Villarreal, Roberto			Increasing Cervical Cancer Screening for a Multiethnic Population of Women in South Texas	JOURNAL OF CANCER EDUCATION			English	Article						Hispanic Americans; Women; Medically uninsured; Cervical cancer; Papanicolaou test; Early medical intervention; Cultural competency	HEALTH COMMUNICATION; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; DISPARITIES; DISEASE	Cervical cancer is a preventable disease. Precancers can be identified and treated through cervical screenings. The HPV vaccine prevents precancers from becoming cancers. The aim of the A Su Salud Cervical Cancer Prevention Program was to apply well-understood health promotion techniques and increase the rate of cervical cancer screening among a high-risk, multiethnic, low-income population in South Texas. Qualitative research was used to identify uptake barriers and tailor media messaging. Using existing resources, we applied evidence-based strategies in novel ways that changed personal behaviors, leading to cancer screening, risk reduction, and early detection. We created a database to track a cohort of 32,807 women and measured cervical cancer screenings over 3 years. Our analysis revealed an increase in cervical cancer screenings after use of highly targeted automated telephone reminders and media dissemination on multiple platforms. Those women at low risk for cervical cancer obtained the highest proportion of Pap tests. This innovative, theory-based program increased overall Pap tests up to 9 % among women enrolled in a safety net hospital financial assistance plan. This study fills a gap in research on Pap test compliance in uninsured, mostly Hispanic women by building on cultural strengths and tailored messaging.

This allows for modelling the assets' real condition in comparison with traditional data acquisition methods. This paper, based on the case study of the basilica in the Baelo Claudia archaeological ensemble (Tarifa, Spain), justifies the need of accurate heritage modelling against excessively simplified approaches in order to support structural safety analysis. To do this, after validating the 3D meshing process from point cloud data, the semi-automatic digital reconstitution of the basilica columns is performed. Next, a geometric analysis is conducted to calculate the structural alterations of the columns. In order to determine the structural performance, focusing both on the accuracy and suitability of the geometric models, static and modal analyses are carried out by means of the finite element method (FEM) on three different models for the most unfavourable column in terms of structural damage: (1) as-built (2) simplified and (3) ideal model without deformations. Finally, the outcomes show that the as-built modelling enhances the conservation status analysis of the 3D heritage city (in terms of realistic compliance factor values), although further automation still needs to be implemented in the modelling process.

High Yield Assembly of Compliant MEMS Snap Fasteners	DETC2008: PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCE AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE , VOL 4			English	Proceedings Paper	ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences/Computers and Information in Engineering Conference	AUG 03-06, 2008	New York, NY	ASME, Design Engn Div, ASME, Comp & Informat Engn Div				Heterogeneous assembly at the microscale has recently emerged as a viable pathway to constructing 3-dimensional microrobots and other miniaturized devices. In contrast to self-assembly, this method is directed and deterministic, and is based on serial or parallel microassembly. Whereas at the meso and macro scales, automation is often undertaken after, and often benchmarked against manual assembly, we demonstrate that deterministic automation at the MEMS scale can be completed with higher yields through the use of engineered compliance and precision robotic cells. Snap fasteners have long been used as a way to exploit the inherent stability of local minima of the deformation energy caused by interference during part mating. In this paper we assume that the building blocks are 2 1/2 -dimensional, as is the case with lithographically microfabricated MEMS parts. The assembly of the snap fasteners is done using mu(3), a multi-robot microassembly station with unique characteristics located at our ARRI's Texas Microfactory lab. Experiments are performed to demonstrate that fast and reliable assemblies can be expected if the microparts and the robotic cell satisfy a so-called "High Yield Assembly Condition" (H.Y.A.C.). Important design trade-offs for assembly and performance of microsnap fasteners are discussed and experimentally evaluated.

Assured automatic dynamic reconfiguration of business processes	INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Dynamic reconfiguration; Controller synthesis; DCR graph	WORKFLOW; VERIFICATION	In order to manage evolving organisational practice and maintain compliance with changes in policies and regulations, businesses must be capable of dynamically reconfiguring their business processes. However, such dynamic reconfiguration is a complex, human-intensive and error prone task. Not only must new business process rules be devised but also, crucially, the transition between the old and new rules must be managed. In this paper we present a fully automated technique based on formal specifications and discrete event controller synthesis to produce correct-by-construction reconfiguration strategies. These strategies satisfy user-specified transition requirements, be they domain independent - such as delayed and immediate change - or domain specific. To achieve this, we provide a discrete-event control theoretic approach to operationalise declarative business process specifications, and show how this can be extended to resolve reconfiguration problems. In this way, given the old and the new business process rules described as Dynamic Condition Response Graphs, and given the transition requirements described with linear temporal logic, the technique produces a control strategy that guides the organisation through a business process reconfiguration ensuring that all transition requirements and process rules are satisfied. The technique outputs a reconfiguration DCR whose traces reproduce the controller's reconfiguration strategy. We illustrate and validate the approach using realistic cases and examples from the BPM Academic Initiative. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Automated messaging can be used in clinical settings to increase dosage of depression treatment and encourage sustained engagement with psychotherapy. Objectives: The aim of this study was to test whether a text messaging adjunct ( mood monitoring text messages, treatment-related text messages, and a clinician dashboard to display patient data) increases engagement and improves clinical outcomes in a group CBT treatment for depression. Specifically, we aim to assess whether the text messaging adjunct led to an increase in group therapy sessions attended, an increase in duration of therapy attended, and reductions in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item (PHQ-9) symptoms compared with the control condition of standard group CBT in a sample of low-income Spanish speaking Latino patients. Methods: Patients in an outpatient behavioral health clinic were assigned to standard group CBT for depression (control condition; n=40) or the same treatment with the addition of a text messaging adjunct (n=45). The adjunct consisted of a daily mood monitoring message, a daily message reiterating the theme of that week's content, and medication and appointment reminders. Mood data and qualitative responses were sent to a Web-based platform (HealthySMS) for review by the therapist and displayed in session as a tool for teaching CBT skills. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses on therapy attendance during 16 sessions of weekly therapy found that patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct stayed in therapy significantly longer (median of 13.5 weeks before dropping out) than patients assigned to the control condition (median of 3 weeks before dropping out; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney z=-2.21, P=.03). Patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct also generally attended more sessions (median=6 sessions) during this period than patients assigned to the control condition (median =2.5 sessions), but the effect was not significant (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney z=-1.65, P=.10). Both patients assigned to the text messaging adjunct (B=-.29, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.19, z=-5.80, P<.001) and patients assigned to the control conditions (B=-.20, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.07, z=-3.12, P=.002) experienced significant decreases in depressive symptom severity over the course of treatment; however, the conditions did not significantly differ in their degree of symptom reduction. Conclusions: This study provides support for automated text messaging as a tool to sustain engagement in CBT for depression over time. There were no differences in depression outcomes between conditions, but this may be influenced by low follow-up rates of patients who dropped out of treatment.

Despite this technological inroad among adolescents, few researchers are utilizing text messaging technology to collect real time, contextualized data. Temporal variables (ie, mood) collected regularly over a period of time could yield useful insights, particularly for evaluating health intervention outcomes. Use of text messaging technology has multiple benefits, including capacity of researchers to immediately act in response to texted information. Objective: The objective of our study was to custom build a short messaging service (SMS) or text messaging assessment delivery system for use with adolescents. The Youth Ecological Momentary Assessment System (YEMAS) was developed to collect automated texted reports of daily activities, behaviors, and attitudes among adolescents, and to examine the feasibility of YEMAS. This system was created to collect and transfer real time data about individual-and social-level factors that influence physical, mental, emotional, and social well-being. Methods: YEMAS is a custom designed system that interfaces with a cloud-based communication system to automate scheduled delivery of survey questions via text messaging; we designed this university-based system to meet data security and management standards. This was a two-phase study that included development of YEMAS and a feasibility pilot with Latino adolescent females. Relative homogeneity of participants was desired for the feasibility pilot study; adolescent Latina youth were sought because they represent the largest and fastest growing ethnic minority group in the United States. Females were targeted because they demonstrate the highest rate of text messaging and were expected to be interested in participating. Phase I involved development of YEMAS and Phase II involved piloting of the system with Latina adolescents. Girls were eligible to participate if they were attending one of the participating high schools and self-identified as Latina. We contacted 96 adolescents; of these, 24 returned written parental consent forms, completed assent processes, and enrolled in the study. Results: YEMAS was collaboratively developed and implemented. Feasibility was established with Latina adolescents (N=24), who responded to four surveys daily for two two-week periods (four weeks total). Each survey had between 12 and 17 questions, with responses including yes/no, Likert scale, and open-ended options. Retention and compliance rates were high, with nearly 18,000 texts provided by the girls over the course of the pilot period. Conclusions: Pilot results support the feasibility and value of YEMAS, an automated SMS-based text messaging data collection system positioned within a secure university environment. This approach capitalizes on immediate data transfer protocols and enables the documentation of participants' thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in real time. Data are collected using mobile devices that are familiar to participants and nearly ubiquitous in developed countries.

Electronic Workflow for Imaging in Clinical Research	JOURNAL OF DIGITAL IMAGING			English	Article						Clinical research; Imaging informatics; Workflow; Electronic medical record	INFRASTRUCTURE; WHITEPAPERS	In the transition from paper to electronic workflow, the University of Colorado Health System's implementation of a new electronic health record system (EHR) forced all clinical groups to reevaluate their practices including the infrastructure surrounding clinical trials. Radiological imaging is an important piece of many clinical trials and requires a high level of consistency and standardization. With EHR implementation, paper orders were manually transcribed into the EHR, digitizing an inefficient work flow. A team of schedulers, radiologists, technologists, research personnel, and EHR analysts worked together to optimize the EHR to accommodate the needs of research imaging protocols. The transition to electronic workflow posed several problems: (1) there needed to be effective communication throughout the imaging process from scheduling to radiologist interpretation. (2) The exam ordering process needed to be automated to allow scheduling of specific research studies on specific equipment. (3) The billing process needed to be controlled to accommodate radiologists already supported by grants. (4) There needed to be functionality allowing exams to finalize automatically skipping the PACS and interpretation process. (5) There needed to be a way to alert radiologists that a specialized research interpretation was needed on a given exam. These issues were resolved through the optimization of the "visit type," allowing a high-level control of an exam at the time of scheduling. Additionally, we added columns and fields to work queues displaying grant identification numbers. The build solutions we implemented reduced the mistakes made and increased imaging quality and compliance.

J	HER, MG; KAZEROONI, H				HER, MG; KAZEROONI, H			AUTOMATED ROBOTIC DEBURRING OF PARTS USING COMPLIANCE CONTROL	JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article								This work presents a method for robotic deburring of two-dimensional planar parts with unknown geometry. Robotic deburring requires "compliancy" and "stiffness" in the robot in the directions tangent and normal to the part, respectively. Compliancy in the tangential direction allows robotic accommodation of tangential cutting forces, while stiffness in the normal direction impedes a robotic response to normal cutting forces. But, to track the part contour, the robot requires compliancy in the normal direction. These conflicting requirements are addressed in this article as two problems: control of the metal removal process and tracking of the part contour. In general, these two problems are coupled; however, here they are separated into a hardware problem and a control problem. A tracking mechanism has been designed and built which incorporates a roller bearing mounted on a force sensor at the robot endpoint. This force sensor is located directly below the cutter and measures the contact forces which are the input to the tracking controller. These contact forces are used not only to calculate the normal vector to the part surface, but also to generate compliancy in the robot. However, the deburring algorithm uses another set of forces (cutting forces generated by the cutter) to produce a stable metal removal process. This deburring control method guarantees compliancy and stiffness in the robot in response to the tangential and normal cutting forces, respectively. Experimental results are given to show the effectiveness of this method for deburring of two-dimensional parts with unknown geometry.

Instead of specialized end effectors, it uses its two-finger grippers to grasp and hold tools to perform subtasks such as screwing and suctioning. A third gripper is used as a precision picking and centering tool, and uses in-built passive compliance to compensate for small position errors and uncertainty. A novel grasp point detection for bin picking is described for the kitting task, using a single depth map. Using the proposed system we competed in the Assembly Challenge of the Industrial Robotics Category of the World Robot Challenge at the World Robot Summit 2018, obtaining 4th place and the SICE award for lean design and versatile tool use. We show the effectiveness of our approach through experiments performed during the competition.

J	BORENSTEIN, J				BORENSTEIN, J			CONTROL AND KINEMATIC DESIGN OF MULTI-DEGREE-OF-FREEDOM MOBILE ROBOTS WITH COMPLIANT LINKAGE	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION			English	Article								Multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) vehicles have many potential advantages over conventional (i.e., 2-DOF) vehicles. For example, MDOF vehicles can travel sideways and they can negotiate tight turns more easily. In addition, some MDOF designs provide better payload capability, better traction, and improved static and dynamic stability. However, MDOF vehicles with more than three degrees-of-freedom are difficult to control because of their overconstrained nature. These difficulties translate into severe wheel slippage or jerky motion under certain driving conditions. These problems make it difficult to benefit from the special motion capabilities of MDOF vehicles in autonomous or semi-autonomous mobile robot applications. This is so because mobile robots (unlike automated guided vehicles) usually rely on dead-reckoning between periodic absolute position updates and their performance is diminished by excessive wheel slippage. This paper introduces compliant linkage, a new concept in the control and kinematic design of MDOF mobile robots. As the name implies, compliant linkage provides compliance between the drive wheels or drive axles of a vehicle, to accommodate control errors which would otherwise cause wheel slippage. The concept of compliant linkage was implemented and tested on a 4-DOF vehicle built at the University of Michigan's Mobile Robotics Lab. Experimental results show that control errors are effectively absorbed by the linkage, resulting in smooth and precise motion. The dead-reckoning accuracy of the complaint linkage vehicle is substantially better than that reported in the literature for other MDOF vehicles; it was found equal to, or even better than that of comparable 2-DOF vehicles.

Data Protection by Design (DPbD) - as coined by Article 25(1) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - therefore calls for an iterative approach based on (i) the notion of risk to data subjects, (ii) a close collaboration between the involved stakeholders, and (iii) accountable decision-making. In practice, however, the legal reasoning behind DPbD is often conducted on the basis of informal system descriptions that lack systematicity and reproducibility. This affects the quality of Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) - i. e. the concrete manifestation of DPbD at the organizational level. This is a major stumbling block when it comes to conducting a comprehensive and durable assessment of the risks that takes both the legal and technical complexities into account. In this article, we present DPMF, a data protection modeling framework that allows for a comprehensive and accurate description of the data processing operations in terms of the key concepts used in the GDPR. The proposed modeling approach accommodates a number of legal reasonings and assessments that are commonly addressed in a DPIA exercise (e. g., the compatibility of purposes). The DPMF is supported in a prototype modeling tool and its practical applicability is validated in the context of a realistic eHealth system for a number of complementary development scenarios.

Today, it is a necessary interaction between workflow management and legal rules that govern it, to allow an efficient control of medical technology and associated costs. Another important topic that is growing in importance within the healthcare sector is compliance, which includes the retention of studies, information security, and patient privacy. Previously, we conducted a series of extensive analysis and measurements of pre-existing operating conditions. These studies and projects have been described in other papers. The first phase: hardware and software installation and initial tests were completed in March 2006. The storage phase was built step by step until the PACS-INR was totally completed. Two important aspects were considered in the integration of components: (1) the reliability and performance of the system to transfer and display DICOM images, and (2) the availability of data backups for disaster recovery and downtime scenarios. This paper describes the high-availability model for a large-scale PACS to support the storage and retrieve of data using CAS and DAS technologies to provide an open storage platform. This solution offers a simple framework that integrates and automates the information at low cost and minimum risk. Likewise, the model allows an optimized use of the information infrastructure in the clinical environment. The tests of the model include massive data migration, openness, scalability, and standard compatibility to avoid locking data into a proprietary technology.

These objectives include interoperability between all components, seamless integration of the Radiology Information System (RIS) with MICAS and eventually other hospital databases, all components must demonstrate DICOM compliance prior to acceptance and automated workflow that can be programmed to meet changes in the healthcare environment. The long-term (10 years) multi-modality archive is being implemented in 3 or more phases with the first phase designed to provide a 12 to 18 month storage solution. This decision was made because the cost per GB of storage is rapidly decreasing and the speed at which data can be retrieved is increasing with time. The open-solution selected allows incorporation of leading edge, "best of breed" hardware and software and provides maximum flexibility of workflow both within and outside of radiology. The selected solution is media independent, supports multiple jukeboxes, provides expandable storage capacity and will provide redundancy and fault tolerance at minimal cost. Some of the required attributes of the archive include scalable archive strategy, virtual image database with global query and object-oriented database. The selection process took approximately 10 months with Cemax-Icon being the vendor selected. Prior to signing a purchase order, Cemax-Icon performed a site survey, agreed upon the acceptance test protocol and provided a written guarantee of connectivity between their archive and the imaging modalities and other MICAS components. The second phase of the archive is currently being planned and installation is scheduled for the second and third quarters of 1999. This phase will provide the capability of accommodating an increasing number of prior fetches and writes to tape without having to significantly increase the number and speed of expensive tape drives. This phase will include upgrading the archive manager (AM) software, adding a second AM and server plus a large capacity RAID without another jukebox in a second computer room to implement fault tolerance and redundancy. The phased approach of archive implementation provides obsolescence protection while minimizing costs by building the archive in phases rather than buying a 5 to 10 year solution at one time. Technology improves and costs decrease with time. The distributed approach of archive implementation provides increased rate of data transmission as well as redundancy and fault tolerance.

Communication, production, distribution, healthcare, transportation, banking, education, entertainment, government, and trade all increasingly rely on systems driven by software. Such systems may be used in ways not anticipated at design time as the context in which they operate is constantly changing and humans may interact with them an unpredictable manner. However, at the same time, we are able to collect unprecedented collections of event data describing what people and organizations are actually doing. Recent developments in process mining make it possible to analyze such event data, thereby focusing on behavior rather than correlations and simplistic performance indicators. For example, event logs can be used to automatically learn end-to-end process models. Next to the automated discovery of the real underlying process, there are process mining techniques to analyze bottlenecks, to uncover hidden inefficiencies, to check compliance, to explain deviations, to predict performance, and to guide users towards "better" processes. Process mining reveals how people really work and often reveals what they would really like to do. Event-based analysis may reveal workarounds and remarkable differences between people and organizations. This keynote paper highlights current research on comparative process mining. One can compare event data with normative process models and see where people deviate. Some of these deviations may be positive and one can learn from them. Other deviations may reveal inefficiencies, design flaws, or even fraudulent behavior. One can also use process cubes to compare different systems or groups of people. Through slicing, dicing, rolling-up, and drilling-down we can view event data from different angles and produce process mining results that can be compared.

Accessibility refers to providing functionality to smart phone apps (and web) so that all human can access contents/service/products on the Internet regardless their age and disability. Accessibility support is essential for mobile users owing to the unique nature and capabilities of mobile devices, such as smaller screens, touch and gesture interface, and built-in screen readers specific to operating systems. The latest mobile device usage statistics showed that between the two different mobile channels, mobile apps and mobile webs, consumers spend most of their time in mobile apps. Accessibility of apps in a smartphone is more important than ever as more people use a smartphone apps to consume content/ service/ product on the Internet. Automated tools for mobile apps that evaluate compliance with accessibility standards are still scarce. This makes it difficult for developers who are unfamiliar with accessibility needs to ensure their apps are accessible by everyone. While the prototype does not include all the functions, it demonstrates that it is feasible to develop a full version of an automatic assessment tool for smartphone apps, which is an under-researched area. This paper designs an accessibility evaluation tool that checks mobile apps for conformance with accessibility standards, and develops a prototype of the evaluation tool.

For example, medical images such as CT or MR are often used for extracting quantitative measurements for the assessment of tumor treatment response while evaluating a chemotherapy drug for therapeutic cancer trials. Quality assurance is defined as "All those planned and systematic actions that are established to ensure that the trial is performed and the data are generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with good clinical practice (GCP) and the applicable regulatory requirement(s)" [1]. Our objective is to build a generalized and an automated framework for quality assurance within the clinical trials workflow. In order to reach this goal, a set of standardized software tools have been developed for quality assurance. Furthermore, we outline some guidelines as recommendations for the users handling the image data within the research workflow. The software tools developed include tools for image selection, image pseudonymization and image quality conformance check. The export tools are developed based on the specifications of the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) Teaching and Clinical Trial Export (TCE) profile. A DICOM-based quality conformance approach has been developed by validating the DICOM header attributes required for a certain imaging application (e. g. CAD, MPR, 3D) and comparing imaging acquisition parameters against the protocol specification. A formal description language is used to represent such quality requirements. For evaluation, imaging data collected from a clinical trial site were validated against Multi-Planar Reconstruction (MPR). We found that out of 60 studies, about 30% of image series volumes failed the MPR check for some common reasons.

Do Peer Effects Improve Hand Hygiene Adherence among Healthcare Workers?	INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							HANDWASHING COMPLIANCE; PERFORMANCE; EDUCATION; FEEDBACK; IMPACT; SPREAD	OBJECTIVE. To determine whether hand hygiene adherence is influenced by peer effects and, specifically, whether the presence and proximity of other healthcare workers has a positive effect on hand hygiene adherence. DESIGN. An observational study using a sensor network. SETTING. A 20-bed medical intensive care unit at a large university hospital. PARTICIPANTS. Hospital staff assigned to the medical intensive care unit. METHODS. We deployed a custom-built, automated, hand hygiene monitoring system that can (1) detect whether a healthcare worker has practiced hand hygiene on entering and exiting a patient's room and (2) estimate the location of other healthcare workers with respect to each healthcare worker exiting or entering a room. RESULTS. We identified a total of 47,694 in-room and out-of-room hand hygiene opportunities during the 10-day study period. When a worker was alone (no recent healthcare worker contacts), the observed adherence rate was 20.85% (95% confidence interval [CI], 19.78%-21.92%). In contrast, when other healthcare workers were present, observed adherence was 27.90% (95% CI, 27.48%-28.33%). This absolute increase was statistically significant (P <.01). We also found that adherence increased with the number of nearby healthcare workers but at a decreasing rate. These results were consistent at different times of day, for different measures of social context, and after controlling for possible confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS. The presence and proximity of other healthcare workers is associated with higher hand hygiene rates. Furthermore, our results also indicate that rates increase as the social environment becomes more crowded, but with diminishing marginal returns.

J	Yvars, PA				Yvars, Pierre-Alain			A Constraint-Based Approach to the Composition Relation Management of a Product Class in Design	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						CSP; constraint programming; product modeling; system architecture; configuration	ARC-CONSISTENCY; PATH CONSISTENCY; NETWORKS	The choice of solution, which a systems architect is confronted with within the framework of a product structure definition, can very quickly prove to be a thorny problem owing to the possible combinatorial system. In this paper we will offer an alternative resting on the utilization of constraint-based programming techniques for representing and managing such complexity. More precisely, we will dwell on the presentation of a constraint-based approach to the composition relation management of a product class in design. After setting forth all the potential of the constraint-based approach, we will formally explain, in more detail, the six types of relations that seem to be essential to building a class of products. The approach is based on a three-level architectural model. The first level concerns the product model as such, the second supplies a formal representation of this model, whereas the third consists of rendering an arithmetic constraint-based approach to the intermediate model. We will use the discrete constraint satisfaction problems for operating and solving the latter Our overall approach, from product modeling to resolution, is intended to be a generic one and the case in point will be the design of a functional pivot link between a connecting rod and a piston. The architect can subsequently make his own choices and the tool will automate their propagation by means of the constraint network modeling the problem. A dimensioning architectural model is, thus, obtained in compliance with the original list of requirements.

J	Nagrath, V; Schlegel, C				Nagrath, Vineet; Schlegel, Christian			SmartTS: A Component-based and Model-Driven Approach to Software Testing in Robotic Software Ecosystem	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Model-Driven Engineering (MDE); Component-based Software Engineering (CBSE); Model-Driven Testing (MDT); Component-based Software Testing (CBST); Service Robotics; Soft-ware Quality; Automated Software Testing	SYSTEMS	Validating the behaviour of commercial off-the-shelf components and of interactions between them is a complex, and often a manual task. Treated like any other software product, a software component for a robot system is often tested only by the component developer. Test sets and results are often not available to the system builder, who may need to verify functional and non-functional claims made by the component. Availability of test records is key in establishing compliance and thus selection of the most suitable components for system composition. To provide empirically verifiable test records consistent with a component's claims would greatly improve the overall safety and dependability of robotic software systems in open-ended environments. Additionally, a test and validation suite for a system built from the model package of that system empirically codifies its behavioural claims. In this paper, we present the "SmartTS methodology": A component-based and model-driven approach to generate model-bound test-suites for software components and systems. SmartTS methodology and tooling are not restricted to the robotics domain. The core contribution of SmartTS is support for test and validation suites derived from the model packages of components and systems. The test-suites in SmartTS are tightly bound to an application domain's data and service models as defined in the RobMoSys (EU H2020 project) compliant SmartMDSD toolchain. SmartTS does not break component encapsulation for system builders while providing them complete access to the way that component is tested and simulated.

The goal of the proposed framework is to construct a safe, flexible, and manageable system containing multi-agent, auto-notice, sensor management, and secure transmission of data to allow an autonomous functioning of RPM. Methods: The literature between 2002 and 2018 that introduces healthcare platforms with the technology of the Internet of things (IoT) is reviewed and compared in compliance with various technical and functional features. Eleven healthcare-based IoT platforms are compared. Eight of them utilize the Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface (REST API), while ten of them have Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), seven of them have device management, and nine of them have security control. In addition, Kepware's KEPServerEX communication platform containing up to 250 communication protocols is included. Results: The results confirm that the proposed framework reliably operates within the complex healthcare processes, taking into account the equipment management, security management, messaging and diversification of communication protocols. This study uses the concept of IoT 3-tier through which a complete sensor management mechanism is structured. Moreover, secure data connection protects the patient's privacy. Each sensor provides a distinctive notification to construct flawless authority management. Conclusions: The proposed framework can not only reach the machine-to-machine (M2M) realm, but also provide support in emergency cases. (C) 2019 Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine.

J	Shen, J; Yan, WJ; Li, P; Xiong, X				Shen, Jie; Yan, Wenjie; Li, Peng; Xiong, Xin			Deep learning-based object identification with instance segmentation and pseudo-LiDAR point cloud for work zone safety	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							DEPTH ESTIMATION; MODEL; VISION	Automated object identification in three-dimensional (3D) space is crucial for work zone safety, such as compliance with construction rules and preventing workplace injuries and deaths. However, it is greatly challenged by some factors like high-quality detection, high-quality instance segmentation, few engineering object datasets with masks, and accurate 3D object understanding due to scale variations and limited cues in the 3D world. Traditional hand-crafted methods suffer from these challenges. Our key insight is to use 2D object detection, instance segmentation and camera vision to compute pseudo-light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point cloud for 3D object identification. On the one hand, an enhanced feature pyramid network is proposed to extract more fine-grained object features, and an improved cascade mask R-CNN is applied to detect bounding boxes and masks for all 2D objects efficiently. Moreover, the AIM dataset for heavy equipment detection is augmented, and a new object class with the bounding box and mask is added. On the other hand, pseudo-LiDAR point clouds of objects based on bounding boxes and masks are recovered from a monocular image by deep learning, automatic camera parameter estimation, vision-based method, and space filter. Extensive experiments and analyses show that the new methodology can identify 3D objects and automatically analyze work zone safety. The proposed object detection model has achieved state-of-the-art results on the AIM dataset and 97.2% in mean average precision for the augmented dataset. The collision detection model using pseudo-LiDAR point cloud has obtained 95.99% in accuracy. The new model will serve as a baseline to support 3D object identification research for other 3D tasks.

Abiotic and spatiotemporal factors affect activity of European bat species and have implications for detectability for acoustic surveys	WILDLIFE BIOLOGY			English	Article						anabat; automated surveys; bat surveying; echolocation; monitoring; ultrasonic detection	LUNAR PHOBIA; INSECTIVOROUS BATS; PIPISTRELLUS-PIPISTRELLUS; VESPERTILIONID BATS; EPTESICUS-NILSSONI; ACTIVITY PATTERNS; FOOD ABUNDANCE; CHIROPTERA; MOONLIGHT; MYOTIS	Bat activity surveys are essential in the contexts of scientific research, conservation, a.c.cessment of ecosystem health, monitoring progress towards sustainable development goals, and legislative compliance in development and infrastructure construction. However, environmental conditions have the potential to influence bat activity and, in turn, their detectability in acoustic surveys. Here we use 3242 hours of acoustic survey data from 323 nights of bat monitoring at 14 sites over a 4-year period to explore the influence of spatiotemporal factors, lunar phase and weather conditions on bat activity. All spatiotemporal and abiotic factors analysed (site, hour post sunset, length of night, duration of moonlight, temperature, rain, wind and cloud cover) contributed to the optimal multivariate model for at least one bat species/genus; all factors except cloud cover and temperature were significant in the optimal model for total bat activity. However, there were notable species-specific differences. Among the key findings were differences between Pipistrellus species, with periods of rainfall being negatively related to soprano pipistrelle Pipistrellus pygmaeus registrations but not those of common pipistrelle Pipistrellus pipistrellus. In addition, overcast conditions showed a strong positive relationship with the number of Myotis registrations while duration of moonlight was positively correlated with common pipistrelle. Temperature was only important for Nyctalus species. These findings demonstrate that understanding the effect multifaceted and interlinked environmental factors on the activity of different bat species is a vital step in developing maximally effective survey protocols, which, in turn, will improve the reliability of conservation and planning decisions underpinned by survey data.

The high costs prompted one organization to analyze surgical delays through a retrospective review of their new electronic health record. Electronic health records have made it easier to access and aggregate clinical data; 2123 operating room cases were analyzed. Implementing a new electronic health record system is complex; inaccurate data and poor implementation can introduce new problems. Validating the electronic health record development processes determines the ease of use and the user interface, specifically related to user compliance with the intent of the electronic health record development. The revalidation process after implementation determines if the intent of the design was fulfilled and data can be meaningfully used. In this organization, the data fields completed through automation provided quantifiable, meaningful data. However, data fields completed by staff that required subjective decision making resulted in incomplete data nearly 24% of the time. The ease of use was further complicated by 490 permutations (combinations of delay types and reasons) that were built into the electronic health record. Operating room delay themes emerged notwithstanding the significant complexity of the electronic health record build; however, improved accuracy could improve meaningful data collection and a more accurate root cause analysis of operating room delays. Accurate and meaningful use of data affords a more reliable approach in quality, safety, and cost-effective initiatives.

Building software-intensive systems that respect the fundamental rights to privacy and data protection is the result of intensive dialogue and careful trade-off decisions. In practice however, there is a dichotomy between the legal reasoning which is conducted in Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) and software engineering approaches, such as threat modeling, aimed at identifying privacy requirements and privacy risks. These activities are commonly performed in total isolation, which negatively impacts (i) the compliance exercise, (ii) the ability to evolve the system over time, and (iii) the architectural trade-offs made during system design. In this article, we present an architectural viewpoint for describing software architectures from a legal, data protection perspective whose core modeling abstractions are based on an in-depth legal analysis of the EU General Data Protection Regulation. This viewpoint is tied to Data Flow Diagrams -commonly used in threat modeling- through correspondence rules. The proposed viewpoint supports the automation of a number of data protection impact assessment steps through (i) meta-model constraints, (ii) model analysis, and (iii) interaction with the involved stakeholders. This enables a streamlined compliance exercise, reconciling legal privacy and data protection notions with architecture-driven software engineering practices. We validate our approach in the context of a realistic e-health application for a number of complementary development scenarios.

In Vivo Expansion of Melanoma-Specific T Cells Using Microneedle Arrays Coated with Immune-Polyelectrolyte Multilayers	ACS BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE & ENGINEERING			English	Article						microneedle; cancer; vaccine; polyelectrolyte multilayer; self-assembly; immunology	VACCINE DELIVERY; DNA VACCINE; INFLUENZA VACCINATION; PENETRATING PEPTIDES; CANCER-IMMUNOTHERAPY; PROSTATE-CANCER; DENDRITIC CELLS; DRUG-DELIVERY; ANTIGEN; NANOPARTICLES	Microneedles (MNs) are micron-scale polymeric or metallic structures that offer distinct advantages for vaccines by efficiently targeting skin-resident immune cells, eliminating injection-associated pain, and improving patient compliance. These advantages, along with recent studies showing therapeutic benefits achieved using traditional intradermal injections in human cancer patients, suggest MN delivery might enhance cancer vaccines and immunotherapies. We recently developed a new class of polyelectrolyte multilayers based on the self assembly of model peptide antigens and molecular toll-like receptor agonists (TLRa) into ultrathin, conformal coatings. Here, we reasoned that these immune polyelectrolyte multilayers (iPEMs) might be a useful platform for assembling cancer vaccine components on MN arrays for intradermal delivery from these substrates. Using conserved human melanoma antigens and a potent TLRa vaccine adjuvant, CpG, we show that iPEMs can be assembled on MNs in an automated fashion. These films, prepared with up to 128 layers, are approximately 200 nm thick but provide cancer vaccine cargo loading >225 mu g/cm(2). In cell culture, iPEM cargo released from MNs is internalized by primary dendritic cells, promotes activation of these cells, and expands T cells during coculture. In mice, application of iPEM-coated MNs results in the codelivery of tumor antigen and CpG through the skin, expanding tumor-specific T cells during initial MN applications and resulting in larger memory recall responses during a subsequent booster MN application. This study support MNs coated with PEMs built from tumor vaccine components as a well-defined, modular system for generating tumor-specific immune responses, enabling new approaches that can be explored in combination with checkpoint blockade or other combination cancer therapies.

An active locking mechanism for assembling 3D micro structures	SMART STRUCTURES, DEVICES, AND SYSTEMS III	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Smart Structures, Devices, and Systems III	DEC 11-13, 2006	Adelaide, AUSTRALIA	SPIE, Defence Sci & Technol Org, Australian Govt Dept Defence, Global Off Naval Res Sci & Technol, Off Naval Res, Asia Off Aerosp Res & Dev, COSNet-ARC Complex Open Syst Res Network, Australian Res Council Nanotechnol Network		MEMS; microassembly; microgripper; 3D micro structures; active locking mechanism	DESIGN	Microassembly is an enabling technology to build 3D microsystems consisting of microparts made of different materials and processes. Multiple microparts can be connected together to construct complicated in-plane and out-of-plane microsystems by using compliant mechanical structures such as micro hinges and snap fasteners. This paper presents design, fabrication, and assembly of an active locking mechanism that provides mechanical and electrical interconnections between mating microparts. The active locking mechanism is composed of thermally actuated Chevron beams and sockets. Assembly by means of an active locking mechanism offers more flexibility in designing microgrippers as it reduces or minimizes mating force, which is one of the main reasons causing fractures in a microgripper during microassembly operation. Microgrippers, microparts, and active locking mechanisms were fabricated on a silicon substrate using the deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) processes with 100-mu m thick silicon on insulator (SOI) wafers. A precision robotic assembly platform with a dual microscope vision system was used to automate the manipulation and assembly processes of microparts. The assembly sequence includes (1) tether breaking and picking up of a micropart by using an electrothermally actuated microgripper, (2) opening of a socket area for zero-force insertion, (3) a series of translation and rotation of a mating micropart to align it onto the socket, (4) insertion of a micropart into the socket, and (5) deactivation and releasing of locking fingers. As a result, the micropart was held vertically to the substrate and locked by the compliance of Chevron beams. Microparts were successfully assembled using the active locking mechanism and the measured normal angle was 89.2 degrees. This active locking mechanism provides mechanical and electrical interconnections, and it can potentially be used to implement a reconfigurable microrobot that requires complex assembly of multiple links and joints.

Development, Implementation, and Evaluation of a Hybrid Electronic Medical Record System Specifically Designed for a Developing World Surgical Service	WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article							COUNTRIES	The Pietermaritzburg Metropolitan Trauma Service previously successfully constructed and implemented an electronic surgical registry (ESR). This study reports on our attempts to expand and develop this concept into a multi-functional hybrid electronic medical record (HEMR) system for use in a tertiary level surgical service. This HEMR system was designed to incorporate the function and benefits of an ESR, an electronic medical record (EMR) system, and a clinical decision support system (CDSS). Formal ethical approval to maintain the HEMR system was obtained. Appropriate software was sourced to develop the project. The data model was designed as a relational database. Following the design and construction process, the HEMR file was launched on a secure server. This provided the benefits of access security and automated backups. A systematic training program was implemented for client training. The exercise of data capture was integrated into the process of clinical workflow, taking place at multiple points in time. Data were captured at the times of admission, operative intervention, endoscopic intervention, adverse events (morbidity), and the end of patient care (discharge, transfer, or death). A quarterly audit was performed 3 months after implementation of the HEMR system. The data were extracted and audited to assess their quality. A total of 1,114 patient entries were captured in the system. Compliance rates were in the order of 87-100 %, and client satisfaction rates were high. It is possible to construct and implement a unique, simple, cost-effective HEMR system in a developing world surgical service. This information system is unique in that it combines the discrete functions of an EMR system with an ESR and a CDSS. We identified a number of potential limitations and developed interventions to ameliorate them. This HEMR system provides the necessary platform for ongoing quality improvement programs and clinical research.	[Skinner, D.

This compliance also makes the robot deflect due to the cutting forces, resulting in poor hole position accuracy and to some extent in poor hole quality. Recently, functionality for high-bandwidth force control has found its way into industrial robot control systems. This could potentially open up the possibility for robotic drilling systems with improved performance, using only standard systems without excessive extra hardware and calibration techniques. Instead of automation with expensive fixtures and precise machinery, our approach was to make use of standard low-cost robot equipment in combination with sensor feedback. The resulting sliding suppression control results in greatly improved hole positioning and quality. The conceptual idea behind the force control is useful also in many other robotic applications requiring external sensor feedback control. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hwang, WS; Tseng, PC				Hwang, WS; Tseng, PC			A QoS-aware Residential Gateway with bandwidth management	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONSUMER ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Residential Gateway; home network; QoS; embedded system	HOME; SERVICE	The Residential Gateway (RG) is the core device of the digital home network. The RG translates communication protocols, coordinates information sharing and serves as a gateway to external networks for integrated multimedia entertainment, on-line services, home security, home automation, information exchange and data storage. Modern home network applications especially for real-time are demanding guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS) for bounded network bandwidth resources. In order to initiate a DiffServ-QoS (Differentiated Services-QoS) bandwidth management mechanism during network congestion, this paper proposes a QRG (QoS-aware Residential Gateway) with both real-time traffic monitoring, DiffServ-QoS and CBQ bandwidth management. Firstly, QRG classifies traffic flow into separate types, with specialized treatment per traffic type to optimize compliance with user-specified priorities. Applications with higher priority get the right to deliver first. Additionally, QRG with built-in traffic control function adopts Class Based Queuing (CBQ) as DiffServ-QoS bandwidth/traffic management for optimized use of bounded network resources. QRG is experimentally implemented on a Linux platform. High-end application is simulated by hosting QRG in a general-purpose PC, while minimum-cost modular application is simulated by hosting QRG in a light-weight low-power ARM920T embedded system. Results show that in both implementations, QRG successfully performs DiffServ-QoS and CBQ bandwidth management functions so that good quality of service and video performance are maintained during network congestion.(1)	Natl Kaohsiung Appl Sci, Dept Elect Engn, Kaohsiung, Taiwan	Hwang, WS (corresponding author), Natl Kaohsiung Appl Sci, Dept Elect Engn, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.	wshwang@mail.ee.kuas.edu.tw; peichen@wshlab2.ee.kuas.edu.tw					Bae CS, 2003, IEEE T CONSUM ELECTR, V49, P1129, DOI 10.1109/TCE.2003.1261207; BALDINE I, 2003, DIVERT SOCKETS MINI; Bansal D, 2003, IEEE COMMUN MAG, V41, P83, DOI 10.1109/MCOM.2003.1193979; BRADEN R, 1997, 2205 IETF RFC; KHAN M, 2000, QUALITY SERVICE CAN; Kushiro N, 2003, IEEE T CONSUM ELECTR, V49, P629, DOI 10.1109/TCE.2003.1233787; LEI B, 2002, P 27 ANN IEEE C LOC; Li X, 2004, IEEE T CONSUM ELECTR, V50, P528, DOI 10.1109/TCE.2004.1309419; Park K, 2003, IEEE T CONSUM ELECTR, V49, P359, DOI 10.1109/TCE.2003.1209526; Saito T, 2000, IEEE T CONSUM ELECTR, V46, P1161, DOI 10.1109/30.920474; Wils A, 2002, IEEE T CONSUM ELECTR, V48, P478, DOI 10.1109/TCE.2002.1037031; ZAHARIADIS T, 2002, ELECTR COMMUN, P133; [No title captured]; [No title captured]	14	15	15	0	2	IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC	PISCATAWAY	445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA	0098-3063	1558-4127		IEEE T CONSUM ELECTR	IEEE Trans.

J	Southern, WR; Lyons, CG				Southern, WR; Lyons, CG			The study of a passive accommodation device in robotic insertion processes	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						robotics; part assembly; remote centre compliant devices		Human involvement in part assembly is successful, however, problems of monotony in manual assembly tasks are considerable. Robotic assembly combines the flexibility of human assembly with the uniform performance and efficiency of hard automation, but is not exclusive of faults and problems. The development of a passive remote centre compliance (RCC) device assisting a 'peg-in-hole' assembly task is the focus of this research. An RCC permits assembly operations by a rigid manipulator, even if misalignment is present. The aim of our research is to combine the theoretical aspects of part mating (e.g. forces, moments, etc.) with the practical aspects that deal with the equipment used (e.g. robot, RCC, controller program etc.). A purpose built gantry robot, to act as a test platform to explore significant variables such as charnfer depth, insertion force and speed, and part geometry was designed. The data accrued will be used to investigate the mathematical relationships for part assembly developed and reported by Whitney [ASME J. Dyn. Syst. Measurement Control 104 (1) (1982) 65]. The imperfections inherent in the 'real world' parameters of the kinematics which define the robot are integrated with existing theoretical models to yield a true mathematical representation of spatial position and force for a simple assembly task.

Despite the considerable body of knowledge that has evolved, constructing and maintaining a safety case remains a significant challenge. Especially for contemporary systems, due to their scale and complexity, safety cases can grow to require hundreds of pages of documentation. In this paper, we propose a method which aims to address these concerns. In numerous safety standards, such as the aerospace ARP4754-A, the concept of Development Assurance Levels (DALs) is used to control the safety assessment process and influence the safety case. Our method is based on automatically constructing a safety argument from an annotated system architecture model. To perform this construction, we employ previous work towards automatically allocating DALs to such a model and combining it with an appropriate safety argument pattern. The method is enabled through the state-of-the-art model-based dependability tool, HiP-HOPS. The advantage of this approach is that when the design changes, the impact of changes can be automatically reflected in the structure of a re-synthesised safety argument for the system.(C) 2016 IFAC (Internantional federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

Because of that, the purpose of this paper is to critically review the Lean and Lean Six Sigma (LSS) methodologies and highlight their importance to achieve sustainable services. To do this, a systematic literature review of the subjects under investigation was conducted. The study has two major contributions. First, it is one of the first researches that examine the compatibility and divergences of Green, Lean and Six Sigma concepts and implications regarding its sustainable implementation in service industry. Second, it provides a holistic Green LSS framework attempting to help practitioners to find ways of institutionalizing it in numerous kinds of services, by pointing out nine critical factors for its implementation, such as continuous customer satisfaction, ethical relations and regulatory compliance, focus on knowledge management and human behaviors, and effective Jidoka automation. The proposed framework indicates new paradigms and pathways to achieve the balance in technical, economic, social and environmental priorities in services.

Small calibre polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane nanocomposite cardiovascular grafts: Influence of porosity on the structure, haemocompatibility and mechanical properties	ACTA BIOMATERIALIA			English	Article						Porosity; Vascular grafts; Mechanical properties; Haemocompatibility; Polyurethane	ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; PLATELET-ADHESION; BYPASS GRAFTS; SHEAR-STRESS; IN-VITRO; SCAFFOLD; CALCIFICATION; NANOMEDICINE; ANGIOGENESIS; BIOMATERIALS	There is a significant worldwide demand for a small calibre vascular graft for use as a bypass or replacement conduit. An important feature in determining the success of a graft is the wall structure, which includes porosity, pore size and pore interconnectivity, as these play a crucial role in determining the long-term patency of a bypass graft. In this study we fabricate a small diameter (<5 mm) vascular graft from polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane-poly(carbonate urea)urethane (POSS-PCU) via an extrusion, phase inversion method using an automated, custom built machine. Through the dispersion of a porogen, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), in controlled concentrations (0-55%) we were able to produce grafts with well-defined pore morphologies. The impact of NaHCO3 concentration on the structure of the graft wall and its influence on the mechanical and haemocompatibility properties are evaluated here. Scanning electron microscopy and mercury porosimetry were used to characterise graft structure. Atomic force microscopy elucidated any changes in surface morphology. The addition of NaHCO3 improved the pore interconnectivity and increasing the concentration of NaHCO3 led to grafts with rougher surfaces and larger pore sizes. The ultimate tensile strength and suture retention decreased with increasing concentrations of NaHCO3, while graft compliance increased. To evaluate haemocompatibility platelets and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were incubated on a range of different graft samples. Platelet adhesion, PBMC surface receptor expression (CD14, CD86, CD69 and HLA-DR) and cytokine release (PF4, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-10, TNF alpha) were all measured. Increasing numbers of platelets adhered to grafts produced with no NaHCO3, which exhibited a smooth surface morphology, and PBMC adherent on these grafts expressed higher levels of CD14 and CD86. Whilst the different graft samples induced varying levels of cytokine secretion in vitro, no distinct pattern suggesting a non-trivial relationship was observed. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc.

J	Powell, MD; Houston, SH				Powell, MD; Houston, SH			Surface wind fields of 1995 Hurricanes Erin, Opal, Luis, Marilyn, and Roxanne at landfall	MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW			English	Article							ANDREW LANDFALL; SOUTH FLORIDA	Hurricanes Erin, Opal, Luis, Marilyn, and Roxanne were the most destructive hurricanes of 1995. At landfall, Luis and Marilyn contained maximum sustained winds (marine exposure) estimated at near 60 and 46 m s(-1), respectively. The strongest landfalling storm of the 1995 season, Luis, decreased in intensity from a category 4 to 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale shortly before the eyewall crossed the Islands of Antigua, Barbuda, St. Kitts-Nevis, St. Barthelemy, St. Martin, and Anguilla. Hurricane Marilyn strengthened as it approached the U.S. Virgin Islands, with St. Thomas bearing the brunt of the north and south eyewall winds of 46 m s(-1) (marine exposure) and St. Croix being affected by the relatively weak western eyewall peak winds of 35-40 m s(-1) (marine exposure). For Luis and Marilyn only surface winds with marine exposures were analyzed because of unknown small-scale interactions associated with complex island terrain with 500-1000-m elevations. Wind engineering studies suggest that wind acceleration over blunt ridges can increase or "speed up" winds by 20%-80%. Topographic effects were evident in damage debris analyses and suggest that an operational method of assessing terrain-induced wind gusts (such as a scaled down mesoscale model) is needed. After landfall as a marginal hurricane over central Florida, Hurricane Erin regained strength over the Gulf of Mexico with a well-defined radar reflectivity structure. Erin struck the Florida panhandle near Navarre Beach with maximum sustained surface winds of 35-40 m s(-1) affecting the Destin-Ft. Walton area. Hurricane Opal made landfall in nearly the identical area as Erin, with maximum sustained surface winds of 40-45 m s(-1), having weakened from an intensity of nearly 60 m s(-1) only 10 h earlier. Opal was characterized by an asymmetric structure that was likely related to cold front interaction and an associated midlevel southwesterly jet. Roxanne struck Cozumel, Mexico, with sustained surface winds (marine exposure) of 46 s(-1), crossed the Yucatan, and meandered in the southwest Gulf of Mexico for several days. While in the Bay of Campeche, Roxanne's large area of hurricane-force winds disabled a vessel, which lead to the drowning deaths of five oil industry workers. High-resolution wind records are critical to preserving an accurate extreme wind climatology required for assessment of realistic building code risks. Unfortunately, power interruptions to Automated Surface Observing Stations on the U.S. Virgin Islands (St. Croix, St. Thomas) and Destin, Florida, prevented complete wind records of the eyewall passages of Marilyn and Opal, respectively.

In the current operating model of NPPs, plant configuration management is highly dependent on large technical staffs. This dependency is because NPPs have a large number of systems and most operations are manually performed. Work processes tend to be fairly complex due to nuclear quality and documentation requirements. NPPs conduct a substantial number of ongoing surveillance activities to verify that plant components are in their required positions (open/close, on/off, etc.) for current and upcoming plant configuration. This puts nuclear energy at somewhat of a long-term economic disadvantage compared to non-nuclear energy generation sources with rising labor costs. Also, it presents human error opportunities, regulatory compliance impacts, and personnel safety hazards. Furthermore, some of these components are located in radiation control zones and result in dose to the surveillance personnel, thereby creating potential nuclear safety hazards. Technology can play a key role in NPP configuration management in offsetting labor costs by automating manually performed plant activities, such as determining the current state of equipment and process parameters. Alternatively, current NPP instrumentation and control systems are approaching their end-of-life and are facing age-related issues, which presents opportunity to upgrade the systems to reduce dependence on manual activities. This paper presents a proof-of-concept prototype intelligent plant configuration management system using available wireless component position sensors to help reduce operating costs for field-based component position verification activities as well as reduce operational challenges due to component position errors. The work focuses on position sensors for selected manual valve types. The wireless network implemented in this work is based on The Internet of Things network since it enables many different devices to communicate between each other across the same network. The proof-of-concept prototype presented in this paper would benefit the nuclear industry in several ways including reduced labor costs, reduced radiation dose, reduced nuclear and personnel safety challenges, and improved plant and regulatory performance.

Based on the Assembly Process Modeling Methodology (APM) developed at the Assembly Automation Laboratory, where the product definition includes both logical and physical building blocks, and the dependencies between them, the development of an Intelligent Task Planning system built upon a Collaborative Web-based environment will enable the integration of the product design process and the assembly system design process. The Product Model definition will consist of a network or hierarchy of interrelated items, where each item has an interface, which contains all the necessary information to verify the item's compliance with the other items in the product definition. The relationships are defined as configuration rules, which can be formally specified in a syntax language. Based on the principle that all intelligent assembly task-planning systems can be structured as a typical knowledge-based system, the use of a software environment that allows the re-use of components, and database independency increases the robustness of the system. The integration of object-oriented and machine learning techniques for intelligent task planning into the system, adds the capability of using complex entities such as Computer-Aided Design (CAD) or Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM) models. The system will serve as an integration point between the product design phase and the assembly system deployment, embracing the capabilities of a web environment, enabling the development team to work remotely over the Internet on one framework, with zero-latency sharing of information. The system enables direct connectivity to Product Data Management (PDM) or Requirements Management (RM) systems, though the use of Java and Extensible Markup Language (XML) technologies. The scope of this research is the final assembly activities in the Electronics and Photonics Industries.

J	Tsilemou, K; Panagiotakopoulos, D				Tsilemou, Konstantinia; Panagiotakopoulos, Demetrios			Approximate cost functions for solid waste treatment facilities	WASTE MANAGEMENT & RESEARCH			English	Article						solid waste treatment facilities; cost functions; cost curves; incineration; composting; anaerobic digestion; landfilling; wmr 915-3		Cost estimation is a basic requirement for planning municipal solid waste management systems. The variety of organizational, financial and management schemes and the continuously developing technological advancements render the economic analysis a complex task, made more complex by the scarcity of real cost data. The objectives of this paper were: (1) to explore the problems arising in getting cost estimates from scattered and limited published data; (2) to suggest a procedure for generating cost functions relating initial set-up cost and operating cost with facility size; and (3) to present such cost functions, relevant to European states, for selected types of solid waste treatment and disposal facilities. Regarding the problems of available scarce data, one needs to deal with cost figures which correspond to facilities with variations in size, technology, year of construction, working conditions, level of technological automation, environmental impacts, social acceptance, capacity utilization rate, composition of inflowing waste, waste management policies, degree of compliance with quality standards, etc. The paper addresses this issue and discusses the proper use of statistical analyses in such cases of fragmented data; moreover, it points out some usual misuses of statistics by analysts and the danger of getting erroneous results. The suggested process for generating cost functions acceptable to the decision-makers is pivoted around the question of acceptable approximation level. Finally, approximate cost curves are suggested for waste-to-energy facilities, landfilling facilities, anaerobic digestion facilities and composting facilities.

J	Kollenbach, P				Kollenbach, Peter			Reprocessing of medical devices in clinical and practical routine	AKTUELLE UROLOGIE			German	Review						KRINKO Recommendations; cystoscopy; medical device; hygienic preparation		Zusammenfassung Anderungen und Neuerungen in der hygienischen Betrachtung von Operationen und bei der Aufbereitung von Medizinprodukten stellen die Praxen und Krankenhauser vor zunehmende Herausforderungen. Die foderalistische Umsetzung der Bestimmungen erschwert es zusatzlich, den uberblick uber samtliche Bestimmungen zu behalten. Die zentralen Dokumente fur den OP-Betrieb stellen die KRINKO-Empfehlungen zur Vermeidung nosokomialer Infektionen (2018) und die Anforderungen an die Medizinprodukteaufbereitung (2012) dar. Eine Unterscheidung nach ambulanten und stationaren Operationen ist aus infektionshygienischer Sicht heutzutage nicht mehr sinnvoll und zielfuhrend. Die Patientenfaktoren, wie Vorerkrankungen, Voroperationen, Adipositas etc. spielen in der Risikobewertung der gesamten operativen Einheit eine zunehmend wichtigere Rolle. Der Betrachtung von Surveillance-Daten wird zunehmende Bedeutung beigemessen. Fur die Aufbereitung der Medizinprodukte (MP) finden sich ebenfalls je nach Konstruktion des MP und dessen Verwendung unterschiedliche Risikobeurteilungen. Die notwendigen Schritte zur Aufbereitung sind durch diese Beurteilung festgelegt. Schwerpunkt in der Aufbereitung wird wohl zunehmend fur die Validierung der Prozesse zu erwarten sein. Eine reproduzierbare, hygienisch einwandfreie Aufbereitung zu erreichen und insbesondere zu dokumentieren bedeutet einen hohen organisatorischen Aufwand. Bei manueller, aber auch bei der maschinellen Aufbereitung mussen fur jeden Arbeitsschritt Anweisungen erstellt werden, die auch dokumentiert und kontrolliert durchgefuhrt werden. Bei der maschinellen Aufbereitung ist der Erfullungsaufwand dabei etwas geringer. Regelma ss ige Schulungen und Fortbildungen sind in jedem Fall unerlasslich. Den betriebswirtschaftlichen Belangen bei der Aufbereitung stehen die Probleme der Finanzierung der mittlerweile hohen hygienischen Anforderungen gegenuber. Verhandlungen uber die KBV sind im Gange. Inwieweit Erfolg zu verzeichnen sein wird, bleibt abzuwarten. Derzeit legen die Krankenkassen eine rigide Haltung an den Tag. Abstract Clinics and hospitals are facing increasing challenges due to changes and reforms regarding the hygienic perspective on surgical procedures and the reprocessing of medical devices. Differences regarding the implementation of provisions in the individual German federal states add to the difficulty of maintaining an overview of all provisions. The KRINKO Recommendations for the Prevention of Nosocomial Infections (2018) and the Requirements for the Reprocessing of Medical Devices (2012) are the central documents for surgical operations. Regarding infection hygiene, it is no longer reasonable and expedient today to differentiate between outpatient and inpatient procedures. Patient factors such as previous illnesses, previous surgical procedures, obesity etc. have come to play a more important role in the risk assessment of the entire surgical unit. More and more importance is being attached to the consideration of surveillance data. For the reprocessing of medical devices, there are also different risk assessments depending on the construction and use of the medical device. The steps required for reprocessing are determined by such assessments. A focus on reprocessing may be expected for the validation of processes. Achieving and, in particular, documenting a reproducible, hygienically correct reprocessing is associated with a high organisational effort. For manual as well as automated reprocessing, instructions have to be created for each task, and these instructions also have to be documented and monitored. For automated reprocessing, compliance efforts are a bit lower. Regular training and further education are essential in each case. In addition to economic issues regarding reprocessing, we are faced with problems financing today's high hygienic requirements. Negotiations involving the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians are ongoing. How successful they are remains to be seen. Health insurance companies are taking a rigid stance these days.

We argue that production lines are key enablers in organizational agility and any hostile and drifting behaviour could turn potential opportunities into losses besides the fact that an agile EIS is well integrated. There are many ISs developed to control and monitor the drifting behaviour of production lines like fault detection and classification (FDC), statistical process control (SPC) and automation systems. These offer excellent detection mechanisms against known drifts; however, real challenge lies in carrying out root-cause analysis for unknown drifts. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new category of IS for production lines as agile PLIS, capable to control, detect, assess and predict the potential drifts for proactive measures. The definition of an agile IS for production line is proposed with quality attributes selected from literature, ISO 91261 software quality standard and specificities of the production line. Further, generic measures of production line agility as local (LAI) and global (GAI) agility indices are proposed to measure the agility drifts for a production line. The agility in an IS is built and not designed: therefore, we also present a compliance matrix of most widely used information system architectures (ISA) against proposed agile PLIS with quality attributes. This paper concludes by validating the proposed quantified measures of agility for agile PLIS using data from reputed semiconductor manufacturer.

Even though an industry-backed standard such as OPC UA can offer substantial added value to these projects, its inherent complexity poses an important obstacle for adopting the technology. Building OPC UA applications requires considerable effort, even when taking advantage of a COTS Software Development Kit (SDK). The OPC Unified Architecture Framework (UAF) attempts to reduce this burden by introducing an abstraction layer between the SDK and the application code in order to achieve a better separation of the technical and the functional concerns. True to its industrial origin, the primary requirement of the framework is to maintain interoperability by staying close to the standard specifications, and by expecting the minimum compliance from other OPC UA servers and clients. UAF can therefore be regarded as a software framework to quickly and comfortably develop and deploy OPC UA-based applications, while remaining compatible to third party OPC UA-compliant toolkits, servers (such as PLCs) and clients (such as SCADA software). In the first phase, as covered by this paper, only the client-side of UAF has been tackled in order to transparently handle discovery, session management, subscriptions, monitored items etc. We describe the design principles and internal architecture of our open-source software project, the first results of the framework running at the Mercator Telescope, and we give a preview of the planned server-side implementation.

However, in context of automotive industry there is an evident gap between the requirements supported by the current automotive manufacturing execution systems (MES) and the requirements proposed by industrial standards from the International Society of Automation (ISA) such as, ISA-95, ISA-88 over which the Industry 4.0 is being built on. In this paper, we bridge this gap by following a model-based requirements engineering approach along with a gap analysis process. Our work is mainly divided into three phases, (i) automotive MES tool selection phase, (ii) requirements modeling phase, (iii) and gap analysis phase based on the modeled requirements. During the MES tool selection phase, we used known reliable sources such as, MES product survey reports, white papers that provide in-depth and comprehensive information about various comparison criteria and tool vendors list for the current MES landscape. During the requirement modeling phase, we specified requirements derived from the needs of ISA-95 and ISA-88 industrial standards using the general purpose Systems Modeling Language (SysML). During the gap analysis phase, we find the misalignment between standard requirements and the compliance of the existing software tools to those standards.	[Kannan, S.

Screening in early pregnancy may identify women at risk of developing hypertensive disease and enable prophylactic treatment. Accurate blood pressure measurement is an important part of this screening. The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients, with the aid of a context-aware sensor-based blood pressure self-measurement system, were able to correctly self-measure their blood pressure adhering to internationally established recommendations. Furthermore, to evaluate patient acceptance levels of performing self-measurements using context-aware adherence aids for guidance. A total of 100 pregnant women attending a routine ultrasound, at gestational week 12, at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Aarhus University Hospital, were recruited in the waiting room before the scheduled scan. Blood pressure self-measurement was performed using a blood pressure self-measurement system called ValidAid consisting of a clinically approved blood pressure device, a sensor chair registering rest-time, back-supported, legs-crossed, and ambient noise levels respectively recording participant compliance, as well as a touch screen-based computer application with an interactive user interface for patient guidance and feedback, as well as a built-in decision support system. Acceptance of the automated self-measurement was evaluated by a questionnaire. In all, 99 percent followed the instructions with regard to both rest time and not talking. For both of these, ValidAid offered interactive and context-aware guidance. The recommendation of keeping legs uncrossed was only adhered to in 69 percent of measurements and back supported in 35 percent of measurements. For both of these, no interactive guidance was provided. The majority of the participants, 93 percent, felt comfortable using self-measurement equipment, while a minority of 8 percent would have preferred personnel-assisted measurements. The majority of participants were able to take reliable blood pressure self-measurements. Results indicate that recommendations that were not actively enforced were not followed to the same extent as those that were enforced. Thus, providing interactive context-aware guidance for all recommendations should be considered in the future. Furthermore, we found patient acceptance levels of performing self-measurements to be overall positive.

J	Abramov, R; Antonova, K				Abramov, Roman; Antonova, Ksenia			Social Adaptation among Graduates from Orphanages in the Russian Media: A Thematic Analysis of Publications for 2014-2015	JOURNAL OF SOCIAL POLICY STUDIES			Russian	Article						a graduate from orphanage; orphans; social adaptation; social service		This article considers images of orphanage graduates formed by the electronic and print media in Russia and is based on the materials from a study entitled 'The trajectories of social and professional adaptation of graduates of children's homes'. The study aimed to obtain analytical information on the socio-psychological and professional adaptation of children from Russian Orphanages. Using the automated media monitoring system 'Medialogia', the authors analyze thematic publications from seven Russian regions: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Irkutsk, Kaliningrad, Novosibirsk, Tver, and Yaroslavl. Textual analysis is based on one hundred articles selected as they enjoy the highest rating of re-quoting and republishing. A thematic map of topics constructed within this analysis shows that the main body of publications is focused on issues of compliance and violation of the orphan rights and the provision of benefits, including housing. Also attracting attention are government, NGOs and private volunteer initiatives in organising adaptation programs for orphans. On the basis of these textual materials, we have developed a thematic typology of media representations of this social group. The following types were unearthed: a positive-independent (successfully adapted and self-made orphanage graduates), a positive-passive (so-called 'adult children'), the negative-independent ('deviants') and negative-passive (orphanhood as a social stigma). What becomes clear is that 'positive-passive' media images are the most common in the printed media at the current moment. This stigmatises orphanage graduates, positioning them as not adapted to 'real' life. The positive-independent media image occurs more rarely, usually only in the context of an orphanage graduate building a successful career. This image corresponds to specific individual biographies, while other media images tend to be devoid of personality or gender characteristics. This, the media forms a 'typical' path in the socialisation of orphan graduates that does not take into account modern pedagogical and psychological practices. These practices are associated with the individual work of educators and social workers with the orphans, who work to prepare children for release from an orphanage or boarding school. The analysis in this paper suggests that the main body of materials on orphanage graduates does not reflect the diversity of problems and challenges faced by this category of citizens.

These inequities increase the burden of chronic disease in low-income populations. Farmers' market subsidies may improve diet quality and psychosocial well-being among low-income populations. In Canada, the British Columbia (BC) Farmers' Market Nutrition Coupon Programme (FMNCP) aims to improve dietary patterns and health among low-income participants by providing coupons to purchase healthy foods from farmers' markets. This study will assess the impact of the BC FMNCP on the diet quality and psychosocial well-being of low-income adults and explore mechanisms of programme impacts. Methods and analysis In a parallel group randomised controlled trial, low-income adults will be randomised to an FMNCP intervention (n=132) or a no-intervention control group (n=132). The FMNCP group will receive 16 coupon sheets valued at CAD$21/sheet over 10-15 weeks to purchase fruits, vegetables, dairy, meat/poultry/fish, eggs, nuts and herbs at farmers' markets and will be invited to participate in nutrition skill-building activities. Overall diet quality (primary outcome), diet quality subscores, mental well-being, sense of community, food insecurity and malnutrition risk (secondary outcomes) will be assessed at baseline, immediately post-intervention and 16 weeks post-intervention. Dietary intake will be assessed using the Automated Self-Administered 24-hour Dietary Recall. Diet quality will be calculated using the Healthy Eating Index-2015. Repeated measures mixed-effect regression will assess differences in outcomes between groups from baseline to 16 weeks post-intervention. Furthermore, 25-30 participants will partake in semi-structured interviews during and 5 weeks after programme completion to explore participants' experiences with and perceived outcomes from the programme. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Calgary Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board, Rutgers University Ethics and Compliance, and University of Waterloo Office of Research Ethics. Findings will be disseminated through policy briefs, conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications.

Cyclodextrin-based dextromethorphan potentiometric sensors	JOURNAL OF ELECTROANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Cyclodextrins; Dextromethorphan; Potentiometric sensors; Coated wire electrodes; Flow injection analysis; Pharmaceutical formulations	ION-SELECTIVE ELECTRODES; MEMBRANE ELECTRODES; CARBON-PASTE; COEFFICIENTS; DERIVATIVES; POLYMER; ACID	The construction and performance characteristics of different dextromethorphan (DXM) potentiometric sensors are described. Three types of electrodes are demonstrated, namely silver coated wire electrode (CWE), coated graphite electrode (CGE) and the conventional PVC membrane electrodes (CE). The cited electrodes are based on cyclodextrins (CDs) ionophores and show a considerable selectivity towards DXM with Nernstian slopes depending on the type of the electrode and the ionophore used. Matrix compositions of each electrode are optimized on the basis of effects of type and concentration of the ionophore as well as influence of the selected plasticizers. CWE incorporated with heptakis (2,3,6-trio-methyl)-beta-CD and sodium tetrakis (4-fluorophenyl) borate (NaTFPB) with o-nitrophenyloctylether (o-NPOE) as membrane plasticizer, showed the best electroanalytical performances. CWEs work satisfactorily in the concentration range from 10(-7) to 10(-2) mol L-1 with Nernstian compliance 59.0 +/- 0.22 mV decade(-1) and detection limit 7.0 x 10(-8) mol L-1. Fast response time of about 4 s and adequate shelf-life (4 weeks) was achieved. The developed electrodes have been successfully applied for the potentiometric determination of DXM in pharmaceutical formulation under batch and flow injection analysis (FIA) conditions. FIA allows the analysis of 90 samples h(-1) and offer the advantage of simplicity, accuracy and automation feasibility. Comparison of the obtained results with those provided by reference method revealed adequate accuracy for control assay. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

BTF provides an integrative approach to the strategic management of marine ecosystems with policies based on restoration ecology, and an understanding of marine ecosystem processes in the light of findings from terrestrial ecology. BTF employs recent developments in whole ecosystem simulation modelling that allow the analysis of uncertainty, tuning to past biomass estimates, and responses to climate changes. It includes new methods for describing past ecosystems, for designing fisheries that meet criteria for sustainability and responsibility, and for evaluating the costs and benefits of fisheries in restored ecosystems. Comparison of ecosystems before and after major perturbations, including investigation of uncertain ecological issues, may set constraints as to what may or may not be restored. Understanding how climate and ocean changes influence marine ecosystems may allow policies to be made robust against such factors. A new technique of intergenerational discounting is applied to economic analyses, allowing policies favouring conservation, as the same time as addressing economic standard discounting of future benefits. Automated searches maximise values of a range of alternative objective functions, and the methodology includes ways to account for uncertainty in model parameters. The evaluation of alternative policy choices, involving trade-offs between conservation and economic values, employs a range of economic, social and ecological measures. BTF policy also utilizes insight into the human dimension of fisheries management. Participatory workshops attempt to maximise compliance by fostering a sense of ownership among all stakeholders: ideally, collaboration by scientists, the maritime community, managers and policy-makers may build intellectual capital in the model, and social capital in terms of increased trust. BTF may help to reverse the shifting baseline syndrome by broadening the cognitive maps of resource users. Some challenges that have still be met include improving methods for quantitatively describing the past, reducing uncertainty in ecosystem simulation techniques and in making policy choices robust against climate change. Critical issues include whether past ecosystems make viable policy goals, and whether desirable goals may be reached from today's ecosystem. Examples are presented from case studies in British Columbia, Newfoundland and the Gulf of St Lawrence in Canada; the Gulf of California, Mexico; the Bali Strait and Komodo National Park in Indonesia; and the South China Sea.

J	Kang, S; Kim, M; Lee, CW; Lee, KI				Kang, S; Kim, M; Lee, CW; Lee, KI			A target-approachable force-guided control with adaptive accommodation for complex assembly	KSME INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL			English	Article						robotic assembly; complex assembly; twist; wrench; target approachability; bounded wrench; adaptive accommodation control; compliance; real-time control	CONTACT LOCALIZATION; SHAPED OBJECTS; MOTION; UNCERTAINTY; ROBOT; TASKS	In this paper, a target approachable force-guided control with adaptive accommodation for complex assembly is presented. Complex assembly (CA) is defined as a task which deals with complex shaped parts including concavity, or whose environment is so complex that unexpected contacts occur frequently during insertion. CA tasks are encountered frequently in the field of manufacturing automation and various robot applications. To make CA successful, both the bounded wrench condition and the target approachability condition should be satisfied simultaneously during insertion. The bounded wrench condition can be satisfied by properly designing accommodation parameters, which depends on the tolerable stiffness for an assembly task, not to exceed the prescribed contact wrench. On the other hand, the target approachability condition can be satisfied by determining an admissible twist minimizing the deviation between the current and target twist. By applying convex optimization techniques, an optimum target approaching twist can be determined at each instantaneous contact state as a global minimum solution. Incorporated with an admissible perturbation method, a new CA algorithm using only the sensed resultant wrench and the target twist is developed without motion planning or contact analysis (which requires the geometry of the part and the environment). To verify the feasibility of the new assembly algorithm, a wench sensor model based an a minimum distance algorithm has been developed and used to estimate contact wrenches in graphic assembly simulation. Finally, a VME bus-based real-time control system is built for experiments on various CA tasks. The T-insertion task as a planar CA, and the double-peg assembly task as a spatial CA, were successfully executed by implementing the new force-guided control with adaptive accommodation.

S	Vogiatzaki, E; Krukowski, A		Ganchev, I; Garcia, NM; Dobre, C; Mavromoustakis, CX; Goleva, R		Vogiatzaki, Emmanouela; Krukowski, Artur			Maintaining Mental Wellbeing of Elderly at Home	ENHANCED LIVING ENVIRONMENTS: ALGORITHMS, ARCHITECTURES, PLATFORMS, AND SYSTEMS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Article; Book Chapter								We describe herein the problem of providing the most cost efficient and effective ways of supporting mental wellbeing as well as methods for physical and mental rehabilitation for elderly at home including a recovery from accidents, particularly concentrating on those impacting brain activities, such as aging-related dementia and stroke, illnesses with very high socio-economic influence. Technologies built in several EU funded projects, e.g. FP7-ICT-StrokeBack, FP7-ICT-ARMOR, Artemis-CHIRON, FP7-SEC-AF3 and other ones, are suitable also for other kinds of health issues, such as recovery from injuries, restoring mobility etc. A common part is stimulating engagement through entertainment, rivalry and "real feeling" of gaming environment, motivating compliance with rehabilitation rules. The automated home system combining progress in ICT and applied clinical know-how allows patients, their direct care providers and family to back the effective use of rehabilitation procedures in their familiar home surroundings instead of unfriendly clinical settings. Our system integrates a set of state of art technologies ranging from augmented/virtual reality gaming, merged with immersive user interfaces for providing mixed reality exercise setting, innovative embedded micro sensor devices with improved power autonomy through use of the newest Bluetooth Smart communication transceivers, combined together into a Personal Health Record (PHR) system supporting the delivery of individual, patient-centred e-health services both at home, at hospital or when mobile. The use of mixed-reality systems, merging interactive virtual components with realistic settings of patient's home, is linked with multi-modal user interfaces stimulating operation of his/her body to accomplish the objective of the exercise, while self-motivation is inspired by rivalry with oneself and other people. This gears to achieving better individual's contribution to rehabilitation procedure, leading to attaining meaningfully quicker regaining of one's earlier abilities. The physiological data is combined with and related to the detected body motion sensing using novel feature extraction and classification procedures handled within a wearable unit, to determine the precision of performed workouts. By using physical intervention only when essential, this disregards expensive human involvement and thus significantly decreases related expenses of Public Health Care services. We start with describing the motivation and needs for such system in Sect. 2, which gives raise to deriving system specifications and architecture as described in Sect. 3. In following Sects. 4 and 5 we described specific technologies developed in our projects, namely Mixed-Reality Rehabilitation Training System integrated into a Personal Health Record (PHR) platform. We then provide the overview of the overall system integrated into a portable unit in Sect. 6, concluding with report on evaluations with users in Sect. 7.

C	Mesick, SM; Gottfried, ST; Roby, E				Mesick, Sharon M.; Gottfried, Susan T.; Roby, Eric			National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Ocean Exploration end-to-end data management: A success story	OCEANS 2005, VOLS 1-3	OCEANS-IEEE		English	Proceedings Paper	Oceans 2005 Conference	SEP 17-23, 2005	Washington, DC	IEEE				The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is the lead federal agency for the ocean exploration initiative, which resulted from the multidisciplinary panel report released in October 2000 "Discovering Earth's Final Frontier: A U.S. Strategy for Ocean Exploration." This report, along with the constituent workshop results, defined a mandate that "Ocean exploration data needs to be readily available to researchers and to the public for education and outreach. " Additional data management mandates are found throughout the government, ranging from the President's Management Agenda through the NOAA Strategic Plan. NOAA's Satellite and Information Service is working cooperatively with the Office of Ocean Exploration and other agencies in an integrated product team to meet these data management mandates through the development of a unique, end-to-end data management system. The goals of this system are to collect, manage, archive and disseminate OE data and information in accordance with nationally accepted formats and standards, to produce information that can be used throughout society to inform citizens and empower decision makers, and to make this information available independently and in perpetuity. NOAA's Ocean Exploration program conducts 25-30 expeditions per year, each of which host one or more independent research projects. The multiplicity of data sources, user requirements, and national standards, as well as the diversity of data collected during each expedition, contribute to the complexity of the OE data management challenge. Information about each research project within the expedition must be tracked from the proposal phase through project completion. At the same time, the assimilation, analysis and distribution of the data collected during each research project must be accomplished. A phased approach to meeting the OE data management challenge was implemented by the IPT. Existing systems used by OE and partners were reviewed and leveraged to provide a short-term solution. The longer term, end-to-end process was modeled and requirements were formalized. Metadata and other reports were standardized, and data were made available to the public in two prototypical systems. The Digital Atlas provides access to geospatially enabled data associated with research activities, and the Video Data Management System publishes video, still imagery, annotations and related documents. Still under development, the long term solution will combine research proposal and cruise planning information with specific vessel and instrumentation information, resulting in a customized interface. This interface will support at-sea data management and at the same will provide a metadata record framework. While using the system to document at-sea operations, data managers will also build metadata record components. Post-cruise, the at-sea information will be synchronized with the primary database. The information will be securely accessible to project principles via the Internet for record editing, completion and publishing. The overarching goal is to compile information as it is collected, to build and publish metadata records that support data access. The publication of metadata will support data access in accordance with any proprietary regulations. Once this system is fully operational, it will streamline data collection, reduce the overall data management burden and simplify compliance with national standards through an automated process. The system will also ensure data availability to the public in near real time and in perpetuity, and will be extensible to other applications.

J	Mikroyannidi, E; Stevens, R; Iannone, L; Rector, A				Mikroyannidi, Eleni; Stevens, Robert; Iannone, Luigi; Rector, Alan			Analysing Syntactic Regularities and Irregularities in SNOMED-CT	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL SEMANTICS			English	Article							LOGIC	Motivation: In this paper we demonstrate the usage of RIO; a framework for detecting syntactic regularities using cluster analysis of the entities in the signature of an ontology. Quality assurance in ontologies is vital for their use in real applications, as well as a complex and difficult task. It is also important to have such methods and tools when the ontology lacks documentation and the user cannot consult the ontology developers to understand its construction. One aspect of quality assurance is checking how well an ontology complies with established 'coding standards'; is the ontology regular in how descriptions of different types of entities are axiomatised? Is there a similar way to describe them and are there any corner cases that are not covered by a pattern? Detection of regularities and irregularities in axiom patterns should provide ontology authors and quality inspectors with a level of abstraction such that compliance to coding standards can be automated. However, there is a lack of such reverse ontology engineering methods and tools. Results: RIO framework allows regularities to be detected in an OWL ontology, i.e. repetitive structures in the axioms of an ontology. We describe the use of standard machine learning approaches to make clusters of similar entities and generalise over their axioms to find regularities. This abstraction allows matches to, and deviations from, an ontology's patterns to be shown. We demonstrate its usage with the inspection of three modules from SNOMED-CT, a large medical terminology, that cover "Present" and "Absent" findings, as well as "Chronic" and "Acute" findings. The module sizes are 5 065, 20 688 and 19 812 asserted axioms. They are analysed in terms of their types and number of regularities and irregularities in the asserted axioms of the ontology. The analysis showed that some modules of the terminology, which were expected to instantiate a pattern described in the SNOMED-CT technical guide, were found to have a high number of regularity deviations. A subset of these were categorised as "design defects" by verifying them with past work on the quality assurance of SNOMED-CT. These were mainly incomplete descriptions. In the worst case, the expected patterns described in the technical guide were followed by only 5% of the axioms in the module. Conclusion: It is possible to automatically detect regularities and then inspect irregularities in an ontology. We argue that RIO is a tool to find and report such matches and mismatches, for evaluations by the domain experts. We have demonstrated that standard clustering techniques from machine learning can offer a tool in the drive for quality assurance in ontologies.

S	Sazonov, SL		Safronova, EI		Sazonov, S. L.			Does China become a world leader in innovation driverless driving technologies?	KITAY V MIROVOY I RYEGIONAL'NOY POLITIKYE: ISTORIYA I SOVRYEMYENNOST', VIPOOSK XXV	Kitaj v Mirovoj i Regional noj Politike Istoria i Sovremennost		Russian	Article; Book Chapter						China; self-driving cars; autonomous driving; artificial intelligence (AI); software; cloud computing; big data; algorithms; multiplicative effect		The article notes that China is rapidly breaking into the promising global market of semi- and automatic car driving technologies, as well as the production of innovative software with integrated driverless autonomous driving capability. The Chinese leadership believes to achieve full automation of vehicles at the end of the 14th Five-year plan - driverless cars will be able to move independently thanks to special software and sensors. Software based on artificial intelligence will control the operation of all car systems, and sensors will collect information about the surrounding environment, which will form the basis of the car's actions the driverless car will analyze the road situation and calculate the correct trajectory. Today, many Chinese manufacturers are creating cars that can move on public roads independently, rather than under the control of a driver, and the leaders in this direction are the corporations Chongqing Changan Automobile, Dongfeng Motor, FAW Group and Hongqi, which are among first global manufacturers of self-driving cars which started working in this direction. The development of driverless automobiles in China creates both significant social and multiplier effects. The number of road accidents drastically diminish and human casualties can be almost completely eliminated, what leads to a significant reduction in the cost of car insurance and urgent response medicine. The cost of transporting goods and people is reduced due to the saving of wages and fuel. The efficiency of using highways increases because of full compliance of driverless cars with traffic rules. New industries related to development, production and maintenance of self-driving cars are emerging, and a significant multiplier effect is being generated in industries related to the production of electronic filling of "smart" cars. As a result, the author shares the opinion that China is already becoming the world's largest market for unmanned vehicles with built-in artificial intelligence (AI) and 5G technologies, which by 2030 can provide China with a significant annual increase in state revenue from the sale of these technologies.

The investigators hypothesize that the observed reduction in cardiac filling may, in part, be due to the absence of a gravitational acceleration dependent, intraventricular hydrostatic pressure difference in mu-G that exists in the ventricle in normal gravity (1-G) due to its size and anatomic orientation. This acceleration-dependent pressure difference, Delta P-LV, between the base and the apex of the heart for the upright posture can be estimated to be 6660 dynes/cm(2) (approximate to 5 mm Hg) on Earth. Delta P-LV promotes cardiac diastolic filling on Earth, but is absent in mu-G. If the proposed hypothesis is correct, cardiac pumping performance would be diminished in mu-G. To test this hypothesis, ventricular function experiments were conducted in the I-G environment using an artificial ventricle pumping on a mock circulation system with the longitudinal axis anatomically oriented for the upright posture at 45 degrees to the horizon. Additional measurements were made with the ventricle horizontally oriented to null Delta P-LV along the apex-base axis of the heart as would be the case for the supine posture, but resulting in a lesser hydrostatic pressure difference along the minor (anterior-posterior) axis. Comparative experiments were also conducted in the It-G environment of orbital space flight on board the Space Shuttle. This paper reviews the use of an automated cardiovascular simulator flown on STS-85 and STS-95 as a Get Away Special payload to test this hypothesis. The simulator consisted of a pneumatically actuated, artificial ventricle connected to a closed-loop, fluid circuit with adjustable compliance and resistance elements to create physiologic pressure and flow conditions. Ventricular instrumentation included pressure transducers in the apex and base as well as immediately upstream of the inflow valve and downstream of the outflow valve, and a flow probe downstream of the outflow valve. By varying the circulating fluid volume, ventricular function could be determined for varying preload pressures at a regulated, mean afterload pressure of 95 mm Hg. This variation in preload condition permitted the construction of a ventricular function curve for the V-G environment for comparison to the same curve for the I-G environment. Data were collected from both missions at the upper end of the ventricular function curve. Experiment operation in the 1-G, supine orientation or in the mu-G environment eliminated the Delta P-LV observed in the 1-G, upright orientation. Consistent with the hypothesis, additional atrial pressure was required in mu-G to obtain stroke volumes and flow rates similar to those measured in 1-G for the upright posture. The necessary increase in atria] pressure was approximately 5 mm Hg in these experiments. In the same range of flow rates and stroke volumes, similar flows were observed in the I-G supine posture for atrial pressures intermediate to the I-G upright and mu-G values, also consistent with the hypothesis. Additional experiments on board the Space Shuttle are in preparation to gather data across the rest of the normal physiologic range of the ventricular function curve.

C	Amin, SM			IEEE	Amin, S. Massoud			Smart Grid Security, Privacy, and Resilient Architectures: Opportunities and Challenges	2012 IEEE POWER AND ENERGY SOCIETY GENERAL MEETING	IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting PESGM		English	Proceedings Paper	General Meeting of the IEEE-Power-and-Energy-Society	JUL 22-26, 2012	San Diego, CA	IEEE Power & Energy Soc				Any complex dynamic infrastructure network typically has many layers, decision-making units and is vulnerable to various types of disturbances. Cyber connectivity has increased the complexity of the control systems and facilities it is intended to safely and reliably control. Thus, in order to defend electric infrastructure against the impacts of cyber-physical attacks, significant challenges must be overcome before extensive deployment and implementation of smart grid technologies can begin. Cyber security and interoperability are two of the key challenges of the smart grid transformation. As for security, it must be built-in as part of its design and NOT glued on as afterthought. Regarding recent cyber threat reports, it is fundamental to separate hype from the truth. What is most concerning about such reports is mainly one piece from an early article: The response to the alert was mixed. An audit of 30 utility companies that received the alert showed that only seven were in full compliance, although all of the audited companies had taken some precautions. This is the reality that needs to be addressed. A key challenge is to enable secure and very high-confidence sensing, communications, and control of a heterogeneous, widely dispersed, yet globally interconnected system. It is even more complex and difficult to control it for optimal efficiency and maximum benefit to the ultimate consumers while still allowing all its business components to compete fairly and freely. In the electric power industry and other critical infrastructures, new ways are being sought to improve network efficiency by eliminating congestion problems without seriously diminishing reliability and security. Effective, intelligent, hierarchically distributed control is required within a layered defense architecture that would enable parts of the networks to remain operational and even automatically reconfigure in the event of local failures or threats of failure. Sensing, communication and control systems are needed across broad temporal, geographical, and industry scalesfrom devices to power-system-wide, from fuel sources to consumers, from utility pricing to demand response, and so on. With increased deployment of feedback and communication, opportunities arise for reducing consumption, for better exploiting renewable sources, and for increasing the reliability and performance of the transmission and distribution networks. At the same time, however, closing loops where they have never been closed before, across multiple temporal and spatial scales, creates control challenges as well. Societal and governmental visions for the smart grid will require the engagement of the controls community for their realization. Feedback, optimization, estimation, dynamics, stability... these and other control system concepts are core to smart grid technology. In many ways, the smart grid is a control problem! Another major strategic goal is to enable real-time demand management and responseto make is possible for customers to modify consumption in reaction to hourly changes in electricity prices and availability. We see inexpensive but advanced two-way secure wireless communications as essential: Dynamic modeling of energy flows, their optimization and control depend on the availability of trustworthy data streams from sensors and monitors distributed throughout the electricity delivery system, for example on power lines and local distribution transformers. Drawing on those inputs and the even more ubiquitous data transmitted securely and wirelessly from substations, operations engineers will be able to spot potential problems and make adjustments before problems arise. As these systems are put in place, they will provide the opportunity to investigate the whole range of issues that arise in connection with the smart grid, from hybrid vehicle integration and electricity market design to system automation and security. If the smart grid is to fulfill its promise, it needs to be not just more efficient but also more robust that our current power systems (which are by no means dumb), both self-healing and highly resistant to attack. Thus, we have developed and assessed a novel cyber-physical security attack detection-framework that is distributed, agent-based, automated, self-configuring and self-tuning, scalable, and lightweight with respect to computational and communications resources being required. Cyber-agents include traffic analyzers, content analyzers, physical-system signals analyzers (such as an agent inspecting voltage, current, rates of change, frequency signals of power lines), and user-behavior analyzers. No matter how many layers of security or the degree of sophistication used in defense mechanisms, it will be essential that the industry hire qualified people. Research findings suggest that human and organizational factors do affect computer and information security performance in a multi-layered fashion. Often vulnerabilities are not the result of a single mistake or configuration error, but numerous latent organizational conditions, such as management support and decisions made by designers that combine to create scenarios where failures and vulnerabilities may occur. In many complex networks, the human participants themselves are both the most susceptible to failure and the most adaptable in the management of recovery. We also are currently investigating the potential savings for groups of distribution customers that are served by backup energy storage systems during a time of outage, using a sophisticated cost model recently developed at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. Enabled by remote load controllers, intelligent load shedding can be implemented on the legacy distribution systems or in microgrids to prioritize emergency power service to critical or high cost-of-outage loads. Taken as a whole, the University of Minnesota smart grid program will provide opportunities to develop, test and demonstrate innovative distribution technologies at all scales: smart room, smart home, and smart microgrids. That is, if successful in all its dimensions, what we have dubbed our smart grid sandbox could be the model for regional distribution systems that are interactive, self-correcting and self-defending. That is, once the smart grid concept has been stress-assessed from micro to macro, stakeholders will be able to see the way forward toward implementing it nationwide.

Improvements can be described in terms of precision in detecting the actual values of the observed variables, efficiency in collecting and processing information, and speed and frequency of feedback given to the participants and stakeholders. The chapter reviews previous research and development in two ways, describing the main tendencies in four continents (Asia, Australia, Europe and the US) as well as summarizing research on how technology advances assessment in certain crucial dimensions (assessment of established constructs, extension of assessment domains, assessment of new constructs and in dynamic situations). As there is a great variety of applications of assessment in education, each one requiring different technological solutions, the chapter classifies assessment domains, purposes and contexts and identifies the technological needs and solutions for each. The chapter reviews the contribution of technology to the advancement of the entire educational evaluation process, from authoring and automatic generation and storage of items, through delivery methods (Internet-based, local server, removable media, mini-computer labs) to forms of task presentation made possible with technology for response capture, scoring and automated feedback and reporting. Finally, the chapter identifies areas for which further research and development is needed (migration strategies, security, availability, accessibility, comparability, framework and instrument compliance) and lists themes for research projects feasible for inclusion in the Assessment and Teaching of Twenty-first Century Skills project. Information communication technology (ICT) offers so many outstanding possibilities for teaching and learning that its application has been growing steadily in every segment of education. Within the general trends of the use of ICT in education, technology-based assessment (TBA) represents a rapidly increasing share. Several traditional assessment processes can be carried out more efficiently by means of computers. In addition, technology offers new assessment methods that cannot be otherwise realized. There is no doubt that TBA will replace paper-based testing in most of the traditional assessment scenarios, and technology will further extend the territories of assessment in education as it provides frequent and precise feedback for participants in learning and teaching that cannot be achieved by any other means. At the same time, large-scale implementation of TBA still faces several technological challenges that need further research and a lot of experimentation in real educational settings. The basic technological solutions are already available, but their application in everyday educational practice, especially their integration into educationally optimized, consistent systems, requires further developmental work. A variety of technological means operate in schools, and the diversity, compatibility, connectivity and co-working of those means require further considerations. Each new technological innovation finds its way to schools but not always in a systematic way. Thus, the possibilities of technology-driven modernization of education-when the intent to apply emerging technological tools motivates changes-are limited. In this chapter, another approach is taken in which the actual and conceivable future problems of educational development are considered and the available technological means are evaluated according to their potential to contribute in solving them. Technology may significantly advance educational assessment along a number of dimensions. It improves the precision of detecting the actual values of the observed variables and the efficiency of collecting and processing information; it enables the sophisticated analysis of the available data, supports decision-making and provides rapid feedback for participants and stakeholders. Technology helps to detect and record the psychomotor, cognitive and affective characteristics of students and the social contexts of teaching and learning processes alike. When we deal with technological issues in educational assessment, we limit our analyses of the human side of the human technology interaction. Although technological problems in a narrow sense, like the parameters of the available instruments-e.g. processor speed, screen resolution, connection bandwidth-are crucial in educational application, these questions play a secondary role in our study. In this chapter, we mostly use the more general term technology-based assessment, meaning that there are several technical tools beyond the most commonly used computers. Nevertheless, we are aware that in the foreseeable future, computers will continue to play a dominant role.

Recent examples of this shift are changing to using robots in the assembly line construction of automobiles or the increasing use of robotics for medical procedures. Most often this is done with cost-reduction in mind, though ease of use for the customer is also a driver. All industries experience the push to increase efficiency of their systems; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the commercial space industry are no different. NASA space communication services are provided by three separately designed, developed, maintained, and operated communications networks known as the Deep Space Network (DSN), Near Earth Network (NEN) and Space Network (SN). The Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Program is pursuing integration of these networks and has performed a variety of architecture trade studies to determine what integration options would be the most effective in achieving a unified user mission support organization, and increase the use of common operational equipment and processes. The integration of multiple, legacy organizations and existing systems has challenges ranging from technical to cultural. The existing networks are the progeny of the very first communication and tracking capabilities implemented by NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) more than 50 years ago and have been customized to the needs of their respective user mission base. The technical challenges to integrating the networks are many, though not impossible to overcome. The three distinct networks provide the same types of services, with customizable data rates, bandwidth, frequencies, and so forth. The differences across the networks have occurred in effort to satisfy their user missions' needs. Each new requirement has made the networks more unique and harder to integrate. The cultural challenges, however, have proven to be a significant obstacle for integration. Over the past few decades of use, user missions and network personnel alike have grown accustomed to the processes by which services are provided by the NASA communications and navigation networks. The culture established by each network has created several challenges that need to be overcome in order to effectively integrate the networks. As with any change, there has been resistance, an apprehension to explore automation of existing processes, and a working environment that attempts to indirectly influence change without mandating compliance. Overcoming technical and cultural challenges is essential to successfully integrating the networks and although the challenges are numerous, the integration of the networks promises a more efficient space communications network for NASA and its customers, as well as potential long-term cost savings to the agency. This paper, Challenges of Integrating NASA Legacy Communications Networks, will provide a brief overview of the current NASA space communications networks as well as the an overview of the process implemented while performing the SCaN Trade Studies and an introduction to the requirements driving integration of the SCaN Networks. This paper will describe in detail the challenges experienced, both technical and cultural, while working with NASA space communications network-specific personnel. The paper will also cover lessons learned during the performance of architecture trade studies and provide recommendations for ways to improve the process.

Evaluation of GNSS RF-Signal Simulators and - Receivers based on Recorded Multi GNSS Signals in Scenarios of Traffic Telematics	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 26TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNICAL MEETING OF THE SATELLITE DIVISION OF THE INSTITUTE OF NAVIGATION (ION GNSS 2013)	Institute of Navigation Satellite Division Proceedings of the International Technical Meeting		English	Proceedings Paper	26th International Technical Meeting of The Satellite-Division-of-the-Institute-of-Navigation (ION GNSS)	SEP 16-20, 2013	Nashville, TN	Inst Navigat, Satellite Div				Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as GPS or GLONASS form a fundamental basis for the optimization of traffic processes over all modes of transport (road, rail, air and water). Reliable location, navigation and timing information of the operating traffic participants serve as a basis for that. In traffic telematics, algorithms to locate and track vehicles, people and objects play an important role. Both the choice of input data in the form of number and type of data to be fused as well as the functioning of algorithms themselves are of decisive importance. Future system concepts, such as fully automated driving, need the compliance of integrity, continuity and especially positioning requirements of the used traffic ways. For example a necessary lane-selective localization of vehicles on the road or a high-precision positioning in inland navigation during a lockage is meant. From operational point of view, field tests for GNSS measurements in rail traffic and inland navigation are difficult in planning, work-intensive in theirs realization and expensive in theirs implementation. Furthermore validation tests regarding receiver hardware and positioning or tracking algorithms require comparable and repeatable signal conditions. In general, this task represents a challenge for GNSS measurements because satellite geometry, ionospheric conditions and environmental reflections change steadily. A solution for the above problems is the use of a modular GNSS radio frequency (RF) signal simulator for mobile field trials. A RF signal simulator consists of a RF generator unit and a RF recorder unit. On the one hand the generator unit is able to output synthetic protocol-compliant GNSS signals and on the other hand it is able to replay GNSS signals reproducibly, recorded during field tests. Both methods offer advantages and disadvantages. The protocol compliant generation of synthetically generated GNSS signals offers the advantage of knowledge about noise performance and artificially generated disturbances (e.g. multipath propagation). Therefore algorithms for their characterization can be developed, analyzed and assessed specifically to the error sources. The disadvantage in using synthetically generated GNSS signals is that error sources can be only limitedly modeled and integrated. In contrast, recorded real measurement data contains all of the above mentioned error sources, but neither their magnitude and occurrence is completely known, nor the error sources can be divided. In this context, the paper discusses the achievable reproducibility of GNSS signal generators used to record and replay field measurements in traffic telematics environments. In this regard, problem scenarios in the field tests are identified and classified in the second part of the paper. For this purpose, representative scenarios in the European rail environment, concretely in the railway network of the DB RegioNetz Erzgebirgsbahn (Germany) and Matterhorn Gotthard Balm (Switzerland), signals were technically analyzed and archived in a signal library. This signal library contains problematic areas, such as one or two sided shading because of woods, rock faces, buildings of rail infrastructure or driving under bridges, in tunnels and gallery tunnels. Based on the GNSS signals generated by using this signal library, qualitative investigations were carried out in terms of achievable track sensitive accuracies. For that reason, several GNSS receivers of different performance and price levels were used. Furthermore, the paper discusses the search for reasons of errors regarding the reproducibility of the calculated locating solutions. Those errors could be found in the subcomponents RF recorder unit, RF generator unit, GNSS receiver and also in the laboratory test setup. The discussion of statistically evaluated results in accuracy and reproducibility follows in the third part of the paper. To detect the causes of these divergences, the GNSS raw data, recorded during playback and converted to RINEX, was analyzed in terms of reproducibility and compared with the real recorded RINEX data during the field measurements. These investigations show that the distance measurements between the satellites and the receivers already have variances from one playback run to another. Consequently the receiver's internal locating algorithms are not or not only accountable for the variances in the locating solutions. Finally the inphase and quadratur (IQ) data, generated by the RF recorder unit during several playback runs, was evaluated to find out whether the RF generator unit inflicts divergences by itself.
