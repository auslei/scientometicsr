The past decade has seen a rapid increase in the adoption of building information modeling (BIM). BIM allows project stakeholders to more effectively define, communicate, and address issues. Yet there are areas in the construction industry not yet taking advantage of the full potential of BIM. For example, the building code development and compliance checking process has yet to be integrated with BIM on a large scale. Numerous attempts have been made to automate code compliance indicating that automation is an aspiration in the industry. One impetus for this movement is that previous and current processes surrounding development of and compliance with building codes and design standards has become increasingly cumbersome over the past three decades. Recent improvements in processing power have allowed advances in BIM technology using machine learning. In an industry that is seeking ways to increase productivity, changing the current code development and compliance checking processes by incorporating BIM and machine learning would have a significantly positive impact on the industry. This paper examines issues around transformation of the code development and compliance process.

Integrating semantic NLP and logic reasoning into a unified system for fully-automated code checking	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Automated code checking; Automated information extraction; Automated reasoning; Building information modeling (BIM); Natural language processing; Logic; Semantic systems; Automated construction management systems	CONSTRUCTION; ONTOLOGY; EXPRESS; IFCOWL; BIM	Existing automated compliance checking (ACC) systems are limited in their automation; they rely on the use of hard-coded, proprietary rules for representing regulatory requirements, which requires major manual effort in extracting regulatory information from textual regulatory documents and coding these information into a rule format. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a new unified ACC system that integrates: (1) semantic natural language processing techniques and EXPRESS data-based techniques to automatically extract and transform both regulatory information (in regulatory documents) and design information [in building information models (BIMs)] for automated compliance reasoning, and (2) semantic logic-based information representation so that the reasoning could be fully automated. To test the proposed system, a BIM test case was checked for compliance with Chapter 19 of the International Building Code 2009. Comparing to a manually-developed gold standard, 98.7% recall and 87.6% precision in noncompliance detection were achieved. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For healthcare projects in the UK, this includes statutory and guidance documents. Existing research indicates that they contain subjective requirements, which challenge the practical adoption of automated compliance checking, leading to limited outcomes. This paper aims to propose recommendations for the adoption of automated compliance checking in the design of healthcare buildings. Design Science Research was used to gain a detailed understanding of how information from existing regulatory requirements affects automation, through an empirical study in the design of a primary healthcare facility. In this study, a previously proposed taxonomy was implemented and refined, resulting in the identification of different types of subjective requirements. Based on empirical data emerging from the research, a set of recommendations was proposed focusing on the revision of regulatory documents, as well as to aid designers implementing automated compliance in practice.

J	Malsane, S; Matthews, J; Lockley, S; Love, PED; Greenwood, D				Malsane, Sagar; Matthews, Jane; Lockley, Steve; Love, Peter E. D.; Greenwood, David			Development of an object model for automated compliance checking	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						BIM standards; Interoperability; Knowledge formalisation; Object model; Compliance checking		Building designs in countries such as the United Kingdom are currently checked manually against a frequently changing and increasingly complex set of building regulations. This is a major task for designers and those bodies that are charged with enforcing the building regulations. As a result this can often lead to ambiguity, inconsistency in assessments and delays in the overall construction process. As the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry moves from 2D Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawings to more semantically rich Building Information Models (BIMs), the development of automated compliance checking systems for building regulations becomes achievable. A format well suited to the automation of compliance checking is that based upon Industry Foundation Class (IFC). IFC has been accepted worldwide as an inter-operability standard. However, whether the IFC data format can fully support the specialised needs of the England and Wales Building Regulations is still debatable. In order to automate their checking, building regulations first need to be interpreted from human-readable free text rules into a set of computer-implementable rules. This paper reviews previous research into automated code compliance-checking, identifies the key issues for future development, and focuses on the analysis of the England and Wales Building Regulations that relate to fire safety for dwelling houses, to determine and subsequently optimize the potential for automated compliance checking. Subsequently, a Building Regulation-specific, semantically rich object model, appropriate for the requirements of automated compliance checking has been developed for England and Wales.

J	Bloch, T; Sacks, R				Bloch, Tanya; Sacks, Rafael			Clustering Information Types for Semantic Enrichment of Building Information Models to Support Automated Code Compliance Checking	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Automated code compliance checking; Building information modeling (BIM); Clustering; Semantic enrichment; Unsupervised learning		Missing, incomplete, implicit, and/or incorrect information are major obstacles to automated code compliance checking in the construction industry. All existing platforms for automated code checking require users to extensively preprocess their input models to supplement missing information before checking can begin. Semantic enrichment using artificial intelligence (AI) can automate much of this normalization process. Progress in the field of semantic enrichment, in turn, requires identification and specification of the information types that must be made explicit, and of the procedures appropriate for each type. After characterizing a broad set of clauses from five diverse building codes, a two-stage clustering process with the k-means algorithm was used to derive a hierarchical classification of semantic enrichment task types. The resulting classification defines 10 tasks that are typically needed for automated code compliance checking. Future research can build on the classification to formalize a knowledge base to inform selection of appropriate approaches for semantic enrichment tasks.

A Review on BIM-Based Automated Code Compliance Checking System	2017 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RESEARCH AND INNOVATION IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS (ICRIIS 2017): SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION THROUGH DATA SCIENCE	International Conference on Research and Innovation in Information Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	5th International Conference on Research and Innovation in Information Systems (ICRIIS) - Social Transformation through Data Science	JUL 16-17, 2017	Langkawi, MALAYSIA			Building Information Modeling (BIM); Industry Foundation Classes (IFC); automated code compliance checking system; rule interpretation		The checking process of the building design with building regulations or codes is a time-consuming and error prone process. The automation of code compliance checking process has been explored since 1960s and becoming more vigorous with the emergence of Building Information Modeling (BIM). A neutral format, Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) which is developed under BIM platform had led to better collaboration and information exchange throughout BIM software and development of the checking system. Generally, the structure of an automated system consists of rule interpretation stage, building model preparation stage, rule execution stage and rule reporting stage. Rule interpretation stage is the most vital and complex stage. In interpreting the rules, various techniques have been investigated and applied to employ comprehensive and accurate checking process on the building designs which are mainly in IFC format. The most common techniques used are by utilizing existing software such as Solibri Model Checker, establishing a plug-in application, adopting object-based approach, logical approach and ontological approach.

A fully automated code compliance checking would be desirable in facilitating a more efficient, cost effective, and human error-proof code checking. Such automation requires automated information extraction from building designs and building codes, and automated information transformation to a format that allows automated reasoning. Natural language processing (NLP) is an important technology to support such automated processing of building codes, because building codes are represented in natural language texts. Part-of-speech (POS) tagging, as an important basis of NLP tasks, must have a high performance to ensure the quality of the automated processing of building codes in such a compliance checking system. However, no systematic testing of existing POS taggers on domain specific building codes data have been performed. To address this gap, the authors analyzed the performance of seven state-of-the-at POS taggers on tagging building codes and compared their results to a manually-labeled gold standard. The authors aim to: (1) find the best performing tagger in terms of accuracy, and (2) identify common sources of errors. In providing the POS tags, the authors used the Penn Treebank tagset, which is a widely used tagset with a proper balance between conciseness and information richness. An average accuracy of 88.80% was found on the testing data. The Standford coreNLP tagger outperformed the other taggers in the experiment. Common sources of errors were identified to be: (1) word ambiguity, (2) rare words, and (3) unique meaning of common English words in the construction context. The found result of machine taggers on building codes calls for performance improvement, such as error-fixing transformational rules and machine taggers that are trained on building codes.

Automated Code Compliance Checking for Building Envelope Design	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Design code; Compliance checking; Building envelope	MODEL	Automating the checking of building envelope design according to design regulations is a complex process because these regulations consist of complicated logic sentences covering multiple functions. Existing mechanisms of building code computer-aided checking have some limitations dealing with design regulations. This paper presents a new integrated approach to automated code compliance checking for building envelope design based on simulation results and building codes. In this approach, building codes and simulation results are seamlessly linked with the compliance checking software. A hierarchical object-based representation of simulation results is proposed as an extended building information model (EBIM) to describe the attributes of a building and its subsystems. A representation of building codes based on decision tables and compatible with the EBIM is also proposed so that users can check the building envelope design against building codes based on the standardized simulation results. A prototype system is developed and a case study gives an example of evaluating the hygrothermal performance of an exterior wall.

The current rule-based compliance checking practice is a costly bottleneck in a building project, and thus, there is a demand for a design evaluation process that incorporates automated checking capabilities to address the inefficiency and the error-prone nature of the current manual checking practice. The inherent complexity of building design rules and impracticability of existing automated checking approaches are two key challenges that must be addressed to enable practical compliance checking automation. This research study proposes a new modularized framework that integrates the emerging open standard, LegalRuleML, with a Visual Programming Language. The framework allows a standardized method of defining design rules in a machine-readable and executable format. The proposed approach encompasses the entire compliance checking process from the interpretation of natural language -based requirements to machine-readable rules, rule categorization, rule parameterization, and the execution of the rules on the ISO-standard building information model. This modularized BIM-based design validation framework is expected to help automatically and iteratively evaluate the level of quality and defects of information conveyed in a given building model as an essential part of the early design process.

J	Beach, TH; Hippolyte, JL; Rezgui, Y				Beach, Thomas H.; Hippolyte, Jean-Laurent; Rezgui, Yacine			Towards the adoption of automated regulatory compliance checking in the built environment	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Automated regulatory compliance; Building information Modelling; Compliance checking; Building performance	BIM; CONSTRUCTION	Automated compliance checking brings advantages to the built environment but, currently, there has been no meaningful adoption, despite the increasing maturity of asset information models. This paper addresses this by ascertaining the blockers/obstacles to adoption and develops a road-map to overcome them. This work has been conducted in the UK and a road-map has been produced to drive forward adoption. More specifically this paper has; assessed the current state of the art in the field and engaged with industry to examine the attitudes to the digitisation of regulatory compliance processes. The results showed that industry believes that adoption of automation was both feasible and desirable, with the caveat that human oversight be maintained. Our road-map's methodical list of steps was judged to have the potential to bring the construction industry to the verge of mass industrialisation of automated compliance checking by 2025.

Automated Compliance Checking of Construction Operation Plans Using a Deontology for the Construction Domain	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Project management; Construction management; Information management; Automation; Artificial intelligence; Deontology; Automated compliance checking; Semantic systems; Automated construction management systems	CODE CHECKING; FRAMEWORK; KNOWLEDGE; ONTOLOGY; DESIGN; LOGIC	Automated compliance checking (ACC) in the construction domain continues to be a challenge. Current ACC systems do not provide the level of knowledge representation and reasoning that is needed to efficiently interpret applicable norms (e.g.,laws, regulations, contractual requirements, advisory practices) and check conformance of designs and operations to those interpretations. In this paper, the authors explore a new approach to ACC and propose to apply theoretical and computational developments in the fields of deontology, deontic logic, and natural language processing to the problem of compliance checking in construction. Deontology is a theory of rights and obligations, and deontic logic is a branch of modal logic that deals with obligations, prohibitions, and permissions. This paper focuses on presenting a deontology for ACC in construction. The deontic model is composed of a hierarchy of normative concepts, interconcept relations, and deontic axioms (rules represented using deontic logic). The deontology was evaluated through formal competency questions, automated consistency checking, automated redundancy checking, expert evaluation, and application-oriented evaluation. The deontic model was manually applied in checking the compliance of storm-water pollution prevention plans with applicable norms. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Automating the checking process can avoid potential calculation mistakes and allow designers to optimize building envelope design more efficiently. To this end, machine-readable code translation with high level of accuracy and correctness is a strong need. This paper thus presents a visual programming language (VPL)-based code translation approach for automated compliance checking of building envelope energy efficiency. Analysis of energy code for building envelope design in Hong Kong is first conducted to identify data sources and key intermediate checking requirements. Based on the identification, atomic methods are selected, and nested program are created, which gives designers and architects the flexibility to reuse these nodes to build or update relevant checking rules. Finally, an architecture of VPL-based energy code translation for overall thermal transfer value (OTTV) checking is presented for future verification of the performance of our approach.

Semantic-Based Logic Representation and Reasoning for Automated Regulatory Compliance Checking	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Automated compliance checking; Automated reasoning; First-order logic; Logic programming; Semantic systems; Automated construction management systems		Existing automated compliance checking (ACC) efforts are limited in their automation and reasoning capabilities; the state of the art in ACC still uses ad hoc reasoning schema/methods, with lack of support for complete automation in ACC reasoning. First-order logic (FOL) representation and reasoning can provide a generalized reasoning method to facilitate complete automation in ACC reasoning. This paper presents a new FOL-based information representation and compliance reasoning (IRep and CR) schema for representing and reasoning about regulatory information and design information for checking regulatory compliance of building designs. The schema formalizes the representation of regulatory information and design information in the form of semantic-based (ontology-based) logic clauses that could be directly used for automated compliance reasoning. Two alternative subschemas, following a closed-world assumption and an open-world assumption for noncompliance detection, respectively, were proposed and tested. The proposed IRep and CR schema was tested in representing and reasoning about quantitative regulatory requirements in Chapter 19 of the International Building Code 2009 and design information of a two-story duplex apartment test case in two ways, using perfect information and imperfect information. The closed-world assumption subschema was selected based on performance results; it achieved 100% recall and precision in noncompliance detection using perfect information and 98.7% recall and 87.6% precision in noncompliance detection using imperfect information.

J	Aydin, M				Aydin, Murat			Building Information Modeling Based Automated Building Regulation Compliance Checking Asp.net Web Software	INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION AND SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Asp.net web software; automated code compliance checking; building information modeling; MVC architectural pattern; C# programming language		Building regulations used in the architecture, engineering, and construction sectors are legal documents prepared under the control of local authorities for use by individuals. These regulations determine the conditions for ensuring performance and quality throughout the entire construction process. The building regulation inspection process conducted with the traditional manual method is time-consuming and error-prone for architects, engineers, and local authorities. It is known that most of these inspections are carried out with municipalities by local authorities. The mutual interview study and literature review shows that there is no standard rule for the legal auditing process and the same services are defined differently by different municipalities. The aim of the study is to create building information modeling based automated building regulation compliance checking software (BIMTRAC3) for municipality users, thereby providing an automated code compliance checking (ACCC) process for housing projects according to the Planned Areas Zoning Regulation in Turkey. It includes a rule-based ACCC method which allows for simultaneous computerized code checking that considers the characteristics of the building elements and the relevant building regulations. It is able to perform the ACCC process and send the ACCC result report of the sample housing project by BIMTRAC3. It provides various solutions for problems experienced by municipalities during the ACCC process.

J	Xue, XR; Zhang, JS				Xue, Xiaorui; Zhang, Jiansong			Building Codes Part-of-Speech Tagging Performance Improvement by Error-Driven Transformational Rules	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Automated compliance checking; Automated information extraction; Natural language processing (NLP); Part-of-speech tagging; Automated construction management systems; Project management; Construction management; Information management; Computer applications; Artificial intelligence	COMPLIANCE CHECKING; SYSTEM; DESIGN	To enable full automation, automated code compliance checking systems need to extract regulatory information in building codes and convert it to computable representations. This conversion is a natural language processing (NLP) task that requires highly accurate part-of-speech (POS) tagging results on building codes. Existing POS taggers, however, do not provide such accuracy on building codes. To address this need, the authors propose to improve the performance of POS taggers by error-driven transformational rules that revise machine-tagged POS results. The proposed method utilizes a syntactic and semantic rule-based, NLP approach combined with a structure that is inspired by transfer learning. This method generates a group of transformational rulesets, from simple ones to complex ones, that will convert machine taggers' tagging results to their corresponding human-labeled gold standard. The transformational rules utilize syntactic and semantic information of domain texts. All rules are constrained not to introduce any new errors when fixing existing errors of machine taggers. The last ruleset, which fixes most common remaining errors in textual data after all other rules are applied, is exempted from this constraint. An experimental test on part-of-speech tagged building code (PTBC) data shows this method reduced 82.7% of errors in POS tagging results of building codes, which increased the POS tagging accuracy on building codes from 89.13% to 98.12%.

J	Altintas, YD; Ilal, ME				Altintas, Yelin Demir; Ilal, Mustafa Emre			Loose coupling of GIS and BIM data models for automated compliance checking against zoning codes	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Automated compliance checking; BIM; Data coupling; GIS; Interoperability	INTEGRATION; MANAGEMENT; SYSTEM	Modeling urban data is crucial for supporting automated code checking processes. Ideally, digitally modelled building codes and urban data should be retrieved from municipalities, and the digital building model should be checked automatically based on the collected information. However, BIM tools do not contain and do not allow managing geographical information at a neighborhood scale. Current GIS applications also do not store all of the information required by building codes. Even if they did, interoperability between GIS and BIM environments are problematic. This paper describes the development of a zoning domain model for automated compliance checking of building projects. The proposed model is illustrated through a proof-of-concept GIS application, where geometric and semantic data are stored, queried and exported as a GML file. Use of this data model for automated code checking is an example for how GIS data can seamlessly complement BIM data making expansion of BIM schemas unnecessary.

Code compliance checks are essential since they standardize the functions a building must fulfill finally. Currently, these controls are cumbersome and error-prone and performed to a large extent manual by the planning consultants as well as authority officers. To enable an automation, the contents of the applicable guidelines have to be translated into a digital format, which can be read, interpreted and applied by machines. Various approaches focused on a textual or hard-coded translation of the guidelines. To increase the involvement of non-programming users, we introduced the visual code checking language, which uses a visual notation to represent the content of directives machine-as well as human-readable.

J	Martins, JP; Monteiro, A				Martins, Joao Pocas; Monteiro, Andre			LicA: A BIM based automated code-checking application for water distribution systems	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						BIM; IFC; Building codes; Automated code-checking; Water distribution networks	DESIGN	Recent advances in Building Information Modeling (BIM) technologies have resulted in a rising demand for real applications of this kind of tools, in addition to the usual standard functions. Building design code-checking is a task that has been found to be suitable for automation, allowing for swifter, more rigorous and transparent procedures. This paper presents research conducted at the University of Porto that has resulted in an original method and a software application for the automated code-checking of building water network designs. Although the methods are based on the main Portuguese regulations, they may be adapted to other countries. The paper presents a review of the core principles behind BIM-based automated code-checking, and discusses the role of the IFC model as a viable format for the exchange of data in a code-checking system, as well as current international automated code-checking initiatives. The authors conclude that automated code-checking procedures can be feasibly implemented in the short term in some domains. and that they may provide a significant incentive towards widespread BIM adoption.

J	Ilal, SM; Gunaydin, HM				Ilal, Sibel Macit; Gunaydin, H. Murat			Computer representation of building codes for automated compliance checking	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building code representation; Automated compliance checking; Semantic modeling; BIM; IFC	FRAMEWORK; MODEL	Development of automated building code compliance checking systems requires appropriate representations for building codes. Building codes are complex documents written in natural languages, and the development of computable representations is challenging. This paper presents a new model and an accompanying modeling methodology for the representation of building codes that may be utilized in the development of future automated compliance checking systems. The new model combines the semantic modeling approach of the SMARTcodes project with the theoretical foundations established by Nyman arid Fenves, namely the four level representation. This hybrid model organizes the representation in four levels and allows for separate modeling of domain concepts, individual rule statements, relationships between rules, and the overall organization of the building code. The model is evaluated with a case study. The Izmir Municipality Housing and Zoning Code is chosen as it is representative of complex building codes that are in effect throughout Turkey. The formalizable rules in the section of Izmir code that apply to all types of buildings, are represented in computer implementable format based on the new model. The research presented in this paper shows that decomposing a building code into four levels and modeling rules based on the semantic-oriented paradigm is an effective modeling strategy for representing building codes in a computable form.

J	Kincelova, K; Boton, C; Blanchet, P; Dagenais, C				Kincelova, Kristina; Boton, Conrad; Blanchet, Pierre; Dagenais, Christian			Fire Safety in Tall Timber Building: A BIM-Based Automated Code-Checking Approach	BUILDINGS			English	Article						BIM; fire safety; compliance checking; building code; visual programming	MODEL	Fire safety regulations impose very strict requirements on building design, especially for buildings built with combustible materials. It is believed that it is possible to improve the management of these regulations with a better integration of fire protection aspects in the building information modeling (BIM) approach. A new BIM-based domain is emerging, the automated code checking, with its growing number of dedicated approaches. However, only very few of these works have been dedicated to managing the compliance to fire safety regulations in timber buildings. In this paper, the applicability to fire safety in the Canadian context is studied by constituting and executing a complete method from the regulations text through code-checking construction to result analysis. A design science approach is used to propose a code-checking method with a detailed analysis of the National Building Code of Canada (NBCC) in order to obtain the required information. The method starts by retrieving information from the regulation text, leading to a compliance check of an architectural building model. Then, the method is tested on a set of fire safety regulations and validated on a building model from a real project. The selected fire safety rules set a solid basis for further development of checking rules for the field of fire safety. This study shows that the main challenges for rule checking are the modeling standards and the elements' required levels of detail. The implementation of the method was successful for geometrical as well as non-geometrical requirements, although further work is needed for more advanced geometrical studies, such as sprinkler or fire dampers positioning.

This displays great challenges for authority to check and verify construction documents and provide permits within a reasonable timeframe. This situation is even getting more critical as building codes and regulations are becoming increasingly complex and variable as they introduce new design criterion and recent advancements in building construction. The need for computerizing the permitting procedure and automating the code compliance auditing process is becoming ever more important. Building information modeling (BIM) has the potential in simplifying the construction permitting process if it can be implemented across trades in Kuwait. Within the context of BIM workflow, automated BIM model checking process against building codes and standards frameworks employs rule-based systems to a proposed design, with results such as "success", "failure" or "warning", or 'unknown' for cases where the needed data is incomplete or missing. This automation method will streamline the permitting process and provide ways to enhance the overall efficiency of the construction industry in Kuwait. This research work seeks to examine the role of BIM in improving the permitting procedure in Kuwait and tackle the defragmentation of the construction industry. The investigation also provides an overview of existing frameworks for automated code verification in building design and particularly architectural and structural design. The paper proposes a new framework for simplifying the permitting procedure for the residential housing in Kuwait.

J	Zhou, P; El-Gohary, N				Zhou, Peng; El-Gohary, Nora			Ontology-based automated information extraction from building energy conservation codes	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Information extraction; Ontology; Natural language processing; Automated compliance checking; Energy conservation codes	CHECKING; DESIGN; SYSTEM	An ontology-based information extraction algorithm for automatically extracting energy requirements from energy conservation codes is proposed. The proposed algorithm aims to support fully-automated energy compliance checking in the construction domain by allowing automated extraction of the requirements from the codes instead of the status quo which relies on manual extraction of requirements from codes and manual formalization of those requirements in a computer-processable format. Automated information extraction from energy conservation codes, compared to other building codes, is a far complex task because many code provisions are long, hierarchically-complex, and with exceptions. A combination of text classification methods, domain-specific preprocessing techniques, ontology-based pattern-matching extraction techniques, sequential dependency based extraction methods, and cascaded extraction methods is proposed to deal with such complexity in extraction. The proposed algorithm was tested in extracting energy requirements from Chapter 4 of the 2012 International Energy Conservation Code, and the results showed 97.4% recall and 98.5% precision.

This research continues our work on the development of a generic model automating the conformance checking of construction projects against building codes. We start from the analysis of the related research on the formalisation and organisation of building codes that allows us to formulate our approach for semantic annotation and scheduling of conformance requirements for conformance checking task. Our approach comprises 5 main steps: formalisation, semantic annotation, classification, context-based scheduling and semantic search of conformance requirements. They are implemented as corresponding key components of the C3R (Conformance Checking in Construction - Reasoning) prototype that we have developed to model the conformance checking process in construction. Finally, we discuss the ongoing work and perspectives of our research: the validation of our model by construction practices and the enrichment of our approach by usage-based knowledge.

J	Xue, XR; Zhang, JS				Xue, Xiaorui; Zhang, Jiansong			Part-of-speech tagging of building codes empowered by deep learning and transformational rules	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Automated compliance checking; Automated information extraction; Natural language processing; Part-of-speech tagging; Automated construction management systems; Deep learning		Automated building code compliance checking systems were under development for many years. However, the excessive amount of human inputs needed to convert building codes from natural language to computer understandable formats severely limited their range of applicable code requirements. To address that, automated code compliance checking systems need to enable an automated regulatory rule conversion. Accurate Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging of building code texts is crucial to this conversion. Previous experiments showed that the state-of-the-art generic POS taggers do not perform well on building codes. In view of that, the authors are proposing a new POS tagger tailored to building codes. It utilizes deep learning neural network model and error-driven transformational rules. The neural network model contains a pre-trained model and one or more trainable neural layers. The pre-trained model was fine-tuned on Part-of-Speech Tagged Building Codes (PTBC), a POS tagged building codes dataset. The fine-tuning of pre-trained model allows the proposed POS tagger to reach high precision with a small amount of available training data. Error-driven transformational rules were used to boost performance further by fixing errors made by the neural network model in the tagged building code. Through experimental testing, the authors found a well-performing POS tagger for building codes that had one bidirectional LSTM trainable layer, utilized BERT_Cased_Base pre-trained model and was trained 50 epochs. This model reached a 91.89% precision without error-driven transformational rules and a 95.11% precision with error-driven transformational rules, which outperformed the 89.82% precision achieved by the state-of-the-art POS taggers.

Ontology-based semantic modeling of regulation constraint for automated construction quality compliance checking	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Construction quality; Compliance checking; Regulation constraint; Ontology; Semantic modeling	INSPECTION; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; SYSTEM; WEB	Regulations play an important role in assuring the construction quality. However, due to the large amount of regulation needs considered, the construction quality compliance checking against regulations can be cumbersome/time-consuming and error prone. In order to give more computerized support to the construction quality compliance checking against regulations, an ontology-based semantic modeling approach of regulation constraints is explored. A meta model for construction quality inspection and evaluation i.e. CQIEOntology is proposed in this paper. Based on CQIEontology, the regulation constraints are modeled into OWL axioms and SWRL rules. By these OWL axioms and SWRL rules, the regulation provisions imposed on construction quality inspection can be translated into a set of inspection tasks, and get associated with the specific construction tasks. Once the construction starts, the applicable inspection tasks, including a series of quality checking and evaluation, will be reminded and recommended. Obviously, the proposed approach facilitates taking the construction quality compliance checking as a paralleling activity to the construction rather than an afterthought, and helps the inspectors in quality inspection. Finally, the approach is demonstrated in Prot g 3.4.6 through case studies based on regulation examples taken from "Code for Acceptance of Construction Quality of Building Foundation (GB50202-2002) and the validation and discussion are given for it."

While current CAD (Computer-Aided Design) systems provide a variety of data representation schemes (e.g. wire-frames, surface, and solid modeling) and data exchange protocols, they fail to address automation issues in retrieval of building information to be used in different AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) applications. The current research concentrates mainly on specific information about spatial relationships between building components to be designed at the preliminary stage. This paper describes a computerized building design framework developed using geometric solid modeling techniques, from which topological information of building components can be automatically generated and extracted to support various aspects in building design such as construction planning, constructability analysis, and building code compliance checking.

Automated Information Transformation for Automated Regulatory Compliance Checking in Construction	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Automated compliance checking; Automated information extraction; Automated information transformation; Natural language processing; Semantic systems; Automated construction management systems	ONTOLOGY; EXTRACTION; FRAMEWORK; DESIGN	To fully automate regulatory compliance checking of construction projects, regulatory requirements need to be automatically extracted from various construction regulatory documents and then transformed into a formalized format that enables automated reasoning. To address this need, the authors propose an approach for automatically extracting information from construction regulatory textual documents and transforming them into logic clauses that could be directly used for automated reasoning. This paper focuses on presenting the proposed information transformation (ITr) methodology and the corresponding algorithms. The proposed ITr methodology utilizes a rule-based, semantic natural language processing (NLP) approach. A set of semantic mapping (SeM) rules and conflict resolution (CoR) rules are used to enable the automation of the transformation process. Several syntactic text features (captured using NLP techniques) and semantic text features (captured using an ontology) are used in the SeM and CoR rules. A bottom-up method is leveraged to handle complex sentence components. A consume and generate mechanism is proposed to implement the bottom-up method and execute the SeM rules. The proposed ITr algorithms were tested in transforming information instances of quantitative requirements, which were automatically extracted from the International Building Code 2009, into logic clauses. The algorithms achieved 98.2 and 99.1% precision and recall, respectively, on the testing data. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.

J	Preidel, C; Borrmann, A				Preidel, Cornelius; Borrmann, Andre			TOWARDS CODE COMPLIANCE CHECKING ON THE BASIS OF A VISUAL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Code Compliance Checking; Visual Programming Language; Building Information Modeling	RULE; BIM	In the AEC industry, there is a large number of standards and codes which ensure the structural stability, reliability, usability of the building under design. Accordingly, checking the conformity of the building design with these requirements is a crucial process. Nowadays this checking is performed to a large extent manually based on two-dimensional technical drawings and textual documents. Due to the low level of automation, the conventional checking procedure is laborious, cumbersome and error-prone. As Building Information Modeling (BIM) becomes more and more mature, a suitable digital information basis also becomes available to enable automating the process. The commercial solutions for code compliance checking available so far mainly follow a black-box approach where the rules that make up a certain regulation are implemented in a hard-wired fashion rendering their implementation in-transparent and non-extendable. A number of researchers have tackled this problem and have proposed various ways that allow the user to define rules, either in a standard programming language or in a dedicated language. However, AEC domain experts usually do not have the required programming skills to use these languages appropriately. To overcome this issue, we introduce the Visual Code Checking Language (VCCL), which uses a graphical notation in order to represent the rules of a code in a machine- and human-readable language. The paper presents the features and functionalities of the VCCL in detail and shows its application in a number of case studies.

There are also many BIM-related research initiatives worldwide. Likewise, the Korean government has joined this trend by improving its existing e-Submission system, SEUMTER, to provide for BIM-based e-submission and automated code compliance checking. Further, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport in Korea has funded the Korea BIM (KBIM) building e-Submission system project. The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data model is an openBlM approach that has been designated as an international standard through the International Organization for Standardization. It is not dependent on specific design tools and is suitable for public works applications. Hence, this study performed a comprehensive analysis of and developed a framework for a prototypical system for an e-Submission process based on the IFC data model. Four main modules were developed to perform code checking, submission, pre-checking, and automated rule-making. A real-world project was used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework. This study could increase the adoption of BIM-based building e-Submission systems by sharing effective and successful processes.

J	Amor, R; Dimyadi, J				Amor, Robert; Dimyadi, Johannes			The promise of automated compliance checking	DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						BIM; Normative provisions; Compliance checking; Automation	EXPERT-SYSTEMS; DESIGN; KNOWLEDGE; BIM; LANGUAGE; RULES	The quest to automate compliance checking processes needed for planning, design, construction and operations has been an active research topic for half a century. Literature has provided evidence of extensive research effort, with varying degrees of success, alongside the evolution of computing and supporting technologies. New innovations in theoretical and applied computing, coupled with a strong industry demand, has opened up opportunities that promise to bring this quest closer to reality. This paper reviews evolving approaches for automated compliance checking, addressing challenges in sharing digital architectural and engineering design information, formalising normative provisions as computable rules, and methods of processing them for compliance. The paper identifies current state-of-the-art implementations, discusses challenges faced in national efforts, and highlights future pathways.

Most previous studies have focused on the processing of design codes for conformance checking. In this work, the writers examine additional issues: the criteria of a building model, the representation of code provisions, the relevance of the provisions with respect to design components, and the encoding of component-based provisions. In this paper, the writers will demonstrate the integration of these issues in the framework in order to develop an effective system to analyze a design for code compliance.

J	Choi, J; Choi, J; Kim, I				Choi, Jungsik; Choi, Junho; Kim, Inhan			Development of BIM-based evacuation regulation checking system for high-rise and complex buildings	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Automated checking system; Building information modeling (BIM); Quality check; Evacuation regulation; High-rise and complex buildings; Industry foundation classes (IFC); Open BIM	CODE COMPLIANCE CHECKING; DESIGN	Recently owing to the increasing requirements for the improvement of qualitative factors of BIM-based design projects, it is necessary to develop an automated checking and evaluation process for the BIM data. Regulation information is an important factor for initial architectural design evaluations. The purpose of this study is to develop an automated system that designers and owners can check the evacuation regulation compliance of BIM data. In this study, the scope of applied regulation information is confined to evacuation regulation, as high-rise and complex building design has high priority and is critical on adequate disaster prevention systems and egress routes. To achieve this purpose, the authors have investigated case studies of BIM-based regulation checking process and illustrated the possible mechanism for the process through evacuation regulation analysis. Based on the presented methodology and scenario of the proposed automated evacuation regulation checking system, the authors developed a prototypical system, called InSightBIM-Evacuation.

These criteria contain both building codes and customer requirements. The paper extends the logic-based reasoning methods used previously in computer-aided visual design to a fuzzy classification. The fuzzy classification of the drawings representing early design solutions is based on approximate reasoning, where different types of criteria are considered. Due to this classification the system is able to evaluate the correspondence of potential solutions to the project specification and check their code compliance. The approach is illustrated by example of designing layouts of a small office.

J	Sydora, C; Stroulia, E				Sydora, Christoph; Stroulia, Eleni			Rule-based compliance checking and generative design for building interiors using BIM	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building information modeling; Rule language; Compliance checking; Generative interior design	LANGUAGE	Building Information Modeling (BIM) is becoming an integral part of the design, architecture, and construction process, as it can integrate all building data in an accessible digital representation that can be viewed in a 3D environment prior to construction. This supports the capability of evaluating a model against building codes or design rules to ensure that the building meets the relevant functional and safety requirements for occupants. However, building regulations are typically represented in natural language and, to date, they have not been created with regard to the digital BIM design process. To automate the design evaluation of a building model, this paper describes a simple, yet extendable, domain-specific language for computationally representing building interior design rules and a method for evaluating rules in this language against a BIM model. Furthermore, previous language-based model-checking approaches have not explored the applicability of their proposed languages beyond model-design evaluation. This paper demonstrates the use of our language in a second, more complex, use case, namely the automated generation of multiple valid alternative model interior designs, compliant to a set of design rules expressed in our language. We have evaluated the usefulness of our language in two generative-design case studies, namely kitchen layouts using a set of real-world kitchen design rules provided by an commercial partner, and living-room layouts using rules put forward in earlier automated-design research. Therefore, this research bridges the concepts of automated model checking and generative design relying on the same rule language.

Semantic NLP-Based Information Extraction from Construction Regulatory Documents for Automated Compliance Checking	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Project management; Construction management; Information management; Computer applications; Artificial intelligence; Documentation; Automated compliance checking; Automated information extraction; Semantic systems; Natural language processing; Automated construction management systems	ONTOLOGY; DESIGN	Automated regulatory compliance checking requires automated extraction of requirements from regulatory textual documents and their formalization in a computer-processable rule representation. Such information extraction (IE) is a challenging task that requires complex analysis and processing of text. Natural language processing (NLP) aims to enable computers to process natural language text in a human-like manner. This paper proposes a semantic, rule-based NLP approach for automated IE from construction regulatory documents. The proposed approach uses a set of pattern-matching-based IE rules and conflict resolution (CR) rules in IE. A variety of syntactic (syntax/grammar-related) and semantic (meaning/context-related) text features are used in the patterns of the IE and CR rules. Phrase structure grammar (PSG)-based phrasal tags and separation and sequencing of semantic information elements are proposed and used to reduce the number of needed patterns. An ontology is used to aid in the recognition of semantic text features (concepts and relations). The proposed IE algorithms were tested in extracting quantitative requirements from the 2009 International Building Code and achieved 0.969 and 0.944 precision and recall, respectively.

Classification of rules for automated BIM rule checking development	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						BIM; Building codes; Code checking; Rule checking	INFORMATION	Automated rule checking has been identified as potentially providing significant value to the AEC industry from both regulatory and industry perspectives. Key challenges to a successful rule checking implementation are the complexities inherent in the rules themselves and the breadth of conditions to which they need to apply. Due to the large number of building codes and theoretically infinite number of rules that can be defined, it is critical to systematize the rules to make the task of rule checking tractable. This paper is a first step towards classifying automated rule checking. In this paper, the authors draw upon their extensive international exposure with various building codes and rule checking areas in the AEC domain to introduce a general classification of rules across application domains using criteria that apply to all known aspects of automated rule checking. The exposure covers both academic research as well as actual production implementation done with CORENET ePlanCheck project in Singapore, and also various pilot implementations in the US and other countries. The authors offer a survey of representative examples of different classes of rules, their key concepts, potential tools required to implement them, and at least one possible solution of each example rule in each category. The examples are drawn from both research domains and existing commercial applications. The aim of this paper is to provide an initial guide for creating a framework for rule classification that articulates both the process challenges and the technology needs to address rule automation.

A Generalized Adaptive Framework (GAF) for Automating Code Compliance Checking	BUILDINGS			English	Article						BIM; IFC; automated code compliance checking; generalized adaptive framework	INFORMATION; MODEL	Building design review is the procedure of checking a design against codes and standard provisions to satisfy the accuracy of the design and identify non-compliances before construction begins. The current approaches for conducting the design review process in an automatic or semi-automatic manner are either based on proprietary, domain-specific or hard-coded rule-based mechanisms. These methods may be effective in their specific applications, but they have the downsides of being costly to maintain, inflexible to modify, and lack a generalized framework of rules and regulations modeling that can adapt to various engineering design realms, and thus don't support a neutral data standard. They are often referred to as Black Box' or Gray Box' approaches. This research offers a new comprehensive framework that reduces the limitations of the cited methods. Building regulations, for instance, are legal documents transcribed and approved by professionals to be interpreted and applied by people. They are hardly as precise as formal logic. Engineers, architects, and contractors can read those technical documents and transform them into scientific notations and software applications. They can extract any data they need, reason about it, and apply it at various phases of the project. How these extraction and use are carried out is a critical component of automating the design review process. The chief goal is to address this issue by developing a Generalized Adaptive Framework (GAF) for a neutral data standard (Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)) that enables automating the code compliance checking processes to achieve design efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The objectives of this study comprise i) to develop a theoretical background to an adaptive framework that supports a neutral data standard for transforming the written code regulations and rules into a computable model, and ii) to define the various modules required for computerizing of the code compliance verification process.

J	Zhong, BT; Gan, C; Luo, HB; Xing, XJ				Zhong, Botao; Gan, Chen; Luo, Hanbin; Xing, Xuejiao			Ontology-based framework for building environmental monitoring and compliance checking under BIM environment	BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Building environmental monitoring; BIM; Ontology; Compliance checking; Semantic web	INFORMATION MODELING BIM; FACILITY MANAGEMENT; CONSTRUCTION; INDUSTRY; DESIGN; SYSTEM; GIS	Building environmental monitoring and compliance checking are important in ensuring environmental performance. The information required for monitoring and checking is obtained from different data sources in different information systems. In this context, information sharing between stakeholders and the semantic interoperability that prevails with varying information systems are necessary. However, the implementation of information sharing and semantic interoperability can be a challenge. This paper proposes an ontology-based framework to support environmental monitoring and compliance checking under building information modeling (BIM) environment among different information systems. The framework integrates building information from BIM, environmental information provided by sensors, and regulatory information based on building regulations and design requirements. In this framework, four specific ontologies are developed to represent relevant knowledge. Building information is extracted from BIM and then converted, together with environmental information provided by sensors, into resource description framework format as ontology instances. The regulation clauses are transformed into SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) rules. A case study is performed to apply the framework, and environmental monitoring and automated compliance checking are implemented in the context of a real distributed energy station project. The testing results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

A rule-based semantic approach for automated regulatory compliance in the construction sector	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Compliance checking; Regulations; Rule engine; Construction industry; Regulatory compliance; Semantics of regulations; Semantics of Regulatory Compliance	MANAGEMENT	A key concern for professionals in any industry is ensuring regulatory compliance. Regulations are often complex and require in depth technical knowledge of the domain in which they operate. The level of technical detail and complexity in regulations is a barrier to their automation due to extensive software development time and costs that are involved. In this paper we present a rule-based semantic approach formulated as a methodology to overcome these issues by allowing domain experts to specify their own regulatory compliance systems without the need for extensive software development. Our methodology is based on the key idea that three semantic contexts are needed to fully understand the regulations being automated: the semantics of the target domain, the specific semantics of regulations being considered, and the semantics of the data format that is to be checked for compliance. This approach allows domain experts to create and maintain their own regulatory compliance systems, within a semantic domain that is familiar to them. At the same time, our approach allows for the often diverse nature of semantics within a particular domain by decoupling the specific semantics of regulations from the semantics of the domain itself. This paper demonstrates how our methodology has been validated using a series of regulations automated by professionals within the construction domain. The regulations that have been developed are then in turn validated on real building data stored in an industry specific format (the IFCs). The adoption of this methodology has greatly advanced the process of automating these complex sets of construction regulations, allowing the full automation of the regulation scheme within 18 months. We believe that these positive results show that, by adopting our methodology, the barriers to the building of regulatory compliance systems will be greatly lowered and the adoption of three semantic domains proposed by our methodology provides tangible benefits.

Extending Building Information Models Semiautomatically Using Semantic Natural Language Processing Techniques	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Automated compliance checking (ACC); Automated information extraction; Building information modeling (BIM); Natural language processing; Semantic systems; Knowledge modeling; Industry foundation classes (IFC) extension; Automated construction management systems	SIMILARITY; PERCEPTRON	Automated compliance checking (ACC) of building designs requires automated extraction of information from building information models (BIMs). However, current industry foundation classes (IFC)-based BIMs provide limited support for ACC, because they lack the necessary information that is needed to perform compliance checking (CC). In this paper, the authors propose a new method for extending the IFC schema to incorporate CC-related information, in an objective and semiautomated manner. The method utilizes semantic natural language processing techniques and machine learning techniques to extract concepts from documents that are related to CC (e. g., building codes) and match the extracted concepts to concepts in the IFC class hierarchy. The proposed method includes a set of methods/algorithms that are combined into one computational platform: (1) a method for concept extraction that utilizes pattern-matching-based rules to extract regulatory concepts from CC-related regulatory documents; (2) a method for concept matching and semantic similarity assessment to select the most related IFC concepts to the extracted regulatory concepts; and (3) a machine learning classification method for predicting the relationship between the extracted regulatory concepts and their most related IFC concepts. The proposed method enables the extension of the IFC schema, in an objective way, using any construction regulatory document. To test and evaluate the proposed method, two chapters were randomly selected from the International Building Code (IBC) 2006 and 2009. Chapter 12 of IBC 2006 was used for training/development and Chapter 19 of IBC 2009 was used for testing and evaluation. Comparing to manually-developed gold standards, 91.7% F1-measure, 84.5% adoption rate, and 87.9% precision were achieved for regulatory concept extraction, IFC concept selection, and relationship classification, respectively.

To automate the compliance checking process, such design information should be automatically extracted from the BIM and matched to the energy rules. This paper proposes an information extraction method for automated extraction of design information from BIMs, and a semantic matching method for automated matching of the extracted information to the energy rules. The Revit API was used to export the design information captured in a Revit model to an industry foundation classes (IFC) data model format. EXPRESS-based information extraction methods and Java-based post-processing techniques were used to parse the exported IFC data model and extract the design information to an intermediate semantic representation. A semantic matching method was developed and used to select the design information that matches/relates to the energy rules. The algorithms for extraction and matching of design information to energy rules were tested and evaluated using the BIM of an educational building and a set of rules extracted from energy codes. A performance of 98.0% recall and 89.2% precision was achieved in matching, which shows that the proposed methods are effective in automatically extracting design information from BIMs and matching the information to energy rules.

Building design and construction process are conditioned by numerous sustainability regulations and assessment measures. With the increasing use of building simulations, the potential of improving design features and promoting efficient construction has become a routine practice, starting at early stages of design and carried out throughout the life cycle of a building. Nevertheless, the construction process is currently lacking the presence of integrated systems that allow dynamic compliance checking of design features with building regulations using instant results from building simulation tools. Such integrated system requires access to regulatory compliance data and appropriate information exchange mechanism between building information model, regulatory requirements and building simulations tools. This paper will present an initiative for developing an integrated system that facilitates managing building performance dynamically through an appropriate information management process combining sustainability regulatory and building simulations with building information modeling. The paper will present a valid implementation results of compliance checking against some criteria of BREEAM assessment process. The quantitative analysis of the results revealed that more than 50% of compliance requirements cannot be fully automated and still requires users input. This is due to the fact that the IFC data model used for data extraction lacks a representation of certain domains of data.

BIM-based modeling and 4D simulation (3D and schedule) has brought many benefits to safety and logistics applications as well. However, only limited automation in modeling and planning safety processes has been exploited so far. The objective of this study is to investigate how potential fall hazards that are unknowingly built into the construction schedule can be identified and eliminated early in the planning phase of a construction project. A survey of research on construction safety and BIM is presented first. Then, a framework was developed that includes automated safety rule-checking algorithms for BIM. The developed prototype was tested using models including an office and a residential building project in Finland. The first case study highlights the comparison of manual vs. automated safety modeling of fall protective systems. It also describes the details to multiple design and asbuilt scenarios where protective safety equipment is modeled. The second case study presents results of applying the framework to the project schedule. It specifically simulates fall hazard detection and prevention. The contribution of this work is an automated rule-checking framework that integrates safety into BIM effectively and provides practitioners with a method for detecting and preventing fall-related hazards. Presented are also discussions of open issues regarding commercialization of the developed prototype and considerations which explore what impact it might have on resolving safety issues in the field by extending traditional safety management practices.

J	Vorg, A; Rosenstiel, W				Vorg, A; Rosenstiel, W			Automation of IP qualification and IP exchange	INTEGRATION-THE VLSI JOURNAL			English	Article						IP packaging; IP compliance; IP quality checking; IP delivery automation; IP transfer format		Current and future SOC designs will use IP cores as basic building blocks. These IP cores have to fulfill defined quality characteristics. Conformance to these characteristics has to be checked automatically, as the increase in complexity makes manual checks infeasible. This article introduces IP quality aspects and describes the IP qualification platform which is able to check quality characteristics of digital soft IP. In order to distribute qualified IP it is essential to introduce an IP exchange process. More than 80% time and resource savings are expected through automated IP delivery which is based on a general IP transfer format. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Haussler, M; Esser, S; Borrmann, A				Haeussler, Marco; Esser, Sebastian; Borrmann, Andre			Code compliance checking of railway designs by integrating BIM, BPMN and DMN	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review						BIM; Infrastructure; Quality; Railway; Design; Code compliance checking; BPMN; DMN	MODEL	Code compliance checking has been the subject of scientific research for more than four decades and has been put into practice in numerous projects. To date, however, no universally valid, sustainable approach to the rulebased compliance checking of models has been established. Visual programming languages are easier to understand and thus more transparent than textual formats. The study presented here analyzes the requirements specified in the guidelines of the Deutsche Bahn AG regarding the technical design of structures in railway construction and examines the feasibility of implementing these rules using BPMN and DMN. The rules analyzed are categorized into 12 different classes. Depending on the guideline subset, the BPMN/DMN approach was found to be useable in 37%-75% of the 943 rules examined. Considering only those rules that are relevant for the digital railway model, 68% of the rules can be represented and automated using BPMN and DMN.

Semantic Text Classification for Supporting Automated Compliance Checking in Construction	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Automated compliance checking; Semantic systems; Automated construction management systems; Natural language processing; Text classification; Machine learning	RECALL	Automated regulatory and contractual compliance checking requires automated rule extraction from regulatory and contractual textual documents (e.g., contract specifications). Automated rule extraction is a challenging task that requires complex processing of text. In the proposed automated compliance checking (ACC) approach, the first step in automating the rule extraction process is automatically classifying the different documents and parts of documents (e.g., contract clauses) into predefined categories (environmental, safety, health, etc.) for preparing it for further text analysis and rule extraction. These categories are defined in a semantic model for normative reasoning. This paper presents a semantic, machine learning-based text classification algorithm for classifying clauses and subclauses of general conditions for supporting ACC in construction. The multilabel classification problem was transformed into a set of binary classification problems. Different machine learning algorithms, text preprocessing techniques, methods of text feature scoring, methods of feature weighting, and feature sizes were implemented and evaluated at different thresholds. The developed classifier achieved 100 and 96% recall and precision, respectively, on the testing data. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

The meaning of requirements is analyzed in a building project context as a basis for data flow analysis: what are the main types of requirements, how they are handled, and what sources they originate from. A literature review has been conducted to find the present development directions in quality checking, besides a market research on present, already widely used solutions. With the conclusions of these research and modern data management theory, the principles of a holistic approach have been defined for quality checking in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. A comparative analysis has been made on current BIM compliance checking solutions according to our review principles. Based on current practice and ongoing research, a state-of-the-art BIM quality control ecosystem is proposed that is open, enables automation, promotes interoperability, and leaves the data governing responsibility at the sources of the requirements. In order to facilitate the flow of requirement and quality data, we propose a model for requirements as Linked Data and provide example for quality checking using Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL). As a result, an opportunity is given for better quality and cheaper BIM design methods to be implemented in the industry.

J	Zhou, P; El-Gohary, N				Zhou, Peng; El-Gohary, Nora			Domain-Specific Hierarchical Text Classification for Supporting Automated Environmental Compliance Checking	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Automated compliance checking; Semantic systems; Automated construction management systems; Natural language processing; Text classification; Machine learning	ONTOLOGY	Automated environmental compliance checking requires automated extraction of rules from environmental regulatory textual documents such as energy conservation codes and EPA regulations. Automated rule extraction requires complex text processing and analysis for information extraction and subsequent formalization of the extracted information into computer-processable rules. In the proposed automated compliance checking (ACC) approach, the text is first classified into predefined categories before information extraction (IE). The advantages are that irrelevant text will be filtered out during text classification (TC) and text with similar semantic meaning will be grouped, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of further IE and compliance reasoning (CR). The categories used for TC are predefined in a semantic TC topic hierarchy, and the classified text is subsequently used in semantic IE and semantic CR. This paper presents the proposed machine learning (ML)-based TC algorithm for classifying clauses in environmental regulatory documents based on the TC topic hierarchy. In developing the algorithm, different text preprocessing techniques, ML algorithms, and performance improvement strategies were tested and used. The final TC algorithm was tested on 10 environmental regulatory documents and evaluated in terms of precision and recall. The algorithm achieved approximately 97 and 84% average recall and precision, respectively, on the testing data.

Bootstrapping Privacy Compliance in Big Data Systems	2014 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON SECURITY AND PRIVACY (SP 2014)	IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy		English	Proceedings Paper	35th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP)	MAY 18-21, 2014	San Jose, CA	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc Techn Comm			INFORMATION-FLOW	With the rapid increase in cloud services collecting and using user data to offer personalized experiences, ensuring that these services comply with their privacy policies has become a business imperative for building user trust. However, most compliance efforts in industry today rely on manual review processes and audits designed to safeguard user data, and therefore are resource intensive and lack coverage. In this paper, we present our experience building and operating a system to automate privacy policy compliance checking in Bing. Central to the design of the system are (a) LEGALEASE-a language that allows specification of privacy policies that impose restrictions on how user data is handled; and (b) GROK-a data inventory for Map-Reduce-like big data systems that tracks how user data flows among programs. GROK maps code-level schema elements to datatypes in LEGALEASE, in essence, annotating existing programs with information flow types with minimal human input. Compliance checking is thus reduced to information flow analysis of big data systems. The system, bootstrapped by a small team, checks compliance daily of millions of lines of ever-changing source code written by several thousand developers.

Furthermore, the design of healthcare facilities is highly constrained by regulations containing a wide range of requirements. Using BIM for automated rule checking has been pointed out as an opportunity to improve requirements management in these projects. However, most existing research is focused on hard-coded approaches or on limited sets of requirements. The aim of this investigation is to propose a semantic-based framework for automated rule checking in the context of healthcare design. An empirical study was conducted in the redevelopment of a university hospital, using Design Science Research as a methodological approach. Results indicate that the nature of regulations and the subjectivity of requirements have a major impact on the possibility of their translation into logical rules, which is needed to enable automated checking. The main theoretical contribution is a taxonomy for automated rule checking and information transformation.

Compared to existing alignment efforts, which are either manual or semi-automated, the proposed method aims to automate the alignment process for supporting fully automated energy compliance checking. A first-level simple alignment method is proposed to align single design information instances to single regulatory concepts, in which (1) domain knowledge is used for interpreting the meaning of concepts to recognize candidate instances, and (2) deep learning is used for capturing the semantics behind the words to measure semantic similarity and select the matches. A final complex alignment method is proposed to recognize the instance groups belonging to a regulatory requirement, in which (1) supervised and unsupervised searching algorithms are used to identify the instance pairs, and (2) network modeling is used to group and link the instance pairs to the requirement. The proposed method showed 93.4% recall and 94.7% precision on the testing data.

The rapid growth of these virtually provisioned cloud networks has increased the demand for automated reasoning tools capable of identifying misconfigurations or security vulnerabilities. This type of automation gives customers the assurance they need to deploy sensitive workloads. It can also reduce the cost and time-to-market for regulated customers looking to establish compliance certification for cloud-based applications. In this industrial case-study, we describe a new network reachability reasoning tool, called Twos, that uses off-the-shelf automated theorem proving tools to fill this need. Twos is the foundation of a recently introduced network security analysis feature in the Amazon Inspector service now available to millions of customers building applications in the cloud. Twos is also used within Amazon Web Services (AWS) to automate the checking of compliance certification and adherence to security invariants for many AWS services that build on existing AWS networking features.

This requires a flexible, iterative development process in which different parts of the system under construction are built and updated concurrently. However, concurrent engineering is quite problematic in domains where different engineering domains and different engineering tools come together. In this paper, we discuss experiences with Van Hoecke Automation, a leading company in the areas of production automation and product processing, in maintaining the consistency between electrical models and the corresponding software controller when both are subject to continuous change. The paper discusses how we let engineers describe the relationships between electrical model and software code in form of links and consistency rules; and how through continuous consistency checking our approach then notified those engineers of the erroneous impact of changes in either electrical model or code.

Generalized Adaptive Framework for Computerizing the Building Design Review Process	JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING			English	Review						Automated design review; Automated code checking; Building information modeling (BIM); Industry Foundation Classes (IFC); Generalized adaptive framework	CODES	Engineering design review is the process of assessing a design against codes and standards requirements to validate the accuracy and quality of the design and detecting problems before manufacturing and assembly begin. Building design regulations are normally in the form of texts, charts, tables, and mathematical expressions. These regulations and guidelines usually have legal status. Nevertheless, the cognitive and logical ability of the people is dissimilar to anything executed in computing machines. Consequently, the computerization of this process represents an actual challenge to the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. Most of the cited methods for automated rules compliance auditing are either based on proprietary, domain-specific, or hard-coded rule-based representations, which may be useful in their specific applications. However, these methods have the disadvantages of being costly to maintain, cumbersome to modify, and lacking a comprehensive schema of rules and regulations modeling that can adapt to different domains, and thus don't support an open data standard. They are often denoted as black box or gray box methods. This work offers a new comprehensive framework that reduces the deficiencies of the current approaches. The primary goal is to tackle the problem by concentrating on establishing a generalized adaptive framework (GAF) for a neutral data standard [such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)] that enables automation of building design review processes to achieve design accuracy and efficiency.

Considering the huge number of models each company possesses, automation of compliance maintenance becomes essential. Therefore, many approaches focused on automation of various aspects of compliance problem, e.g., compliance verification. Such techniques allow localizing the problem within the process model. However, they are not able to resolve the violations. In this paper we address the problem of (semi) automatic violation resolution, addressing violations of execution ordering compliance rules. We build upon previous work in categorizing the violations into types and employ automated planning to ensure compliance. The problem of choosing the concrete resolution strategy is addressed by the concept of context.

However, the nature of rules (expressed in natural language) and the large amount of elements that can be involved in them make their materialization and automated checking quite difficult. That is why the existing support for compliance checking is generally restricted to specific kinds of rules (e.g. rules affecting the control flow of the process). In this paper, we introduce compliance mashups, and show how a mashup-based approach can help solve the problem of rule specification and checking at design time. Some advantages of such an approach are that: (i) any kind of rule can be specified, which implies that each user can specify a rule according to his/her interpretation of the rule; (ii) building the compliance mashup is transparent to the formalism(s) used to implement it, so different techniques can be used together; and (iv) mashup components or parts of them can be re-used. As an example we use this approach to build mashups to specify and check rules related to human resource management in business processes at design time.

An automated standard-based life cycle quality inspection methodology for smart precast concrete solutions in buildings	JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY AND MAINTENANCE			English	Article						Quality checks; smart construction; precast concrete; embedded sensors; methodology; quality assurance	FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY; SENSOR; INSTALLATION; PERFORMANCE; TRACKING; MODELS	Built2Spec research project brought together a new and breakthrough set of tools in order to improve construction quality inspection processes. These can be put into the hands of construction stakeholders to help meet Europe's energy efficiency targets, standards for constructing and retrofitting buildings, and related policy ambitions. This paper focuses on the automated standard-based life cycle quality inspections for precast concrete structural building elements that can be enhanced by leveraging a range of different technologies. Particular attention is placed on the use of embedded sensors in the precast concrete structural building elements as a tool to support quality assurance of these elements. Starting with the design, through manufacturing, delivery to site, installation, commissioning and operation until the end of life, the performance of precast concrete building elements is monitored and controlled to ensure their compliance with specifications, standards and guidelines. The outputs of proposed technologies integrated within the virtual construction management platform (VCMP) can enable automated continuous quality checks, while making them accessible to stakeholders through the life of a building. The measurements to support the development of this methodology were provided by a newly constructed demonstration building in Ireland.

Facilitating the BIM coordinator and empowering the suppliers with automated data compliance checking	EWORK AND EBUSINESS IN ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION			English	Proceedings Paper	11th European Conference on Product and Process Modelling (ECPPM)	SEP 07-09, 2016	Limassol, CYPRUS					In projects with Building Information Modelling (BIM), the collaboration among the various actors is a very intricate and intensive process. The various suppliers and engineers provide their input in Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which in turn is used for design coordination. However, the IFCs have to undergo an intermediate checking process to ensure compliance with various client-set and technical requirements. The paper focuses on the potential of (semi-) automatic IFC compliance checks and discusses a relevant recent initiative in the Netherlands, according to which several IFC compliance criteria were agreed among 14 contractors. This study aims to unravel the changes induced by this development not only as to the IFC compliance checks, but also as to potentially balancing the roles between the BIM coordinator and the suppliers.

Increasing regulation and need for reduced time-to-market has led enterprises to look to technology to scale and automate their compliance efforts. Automated compliance checking approaches proposed in research need human experts to formally encode rules, as well as to extract the relevant data from enterprise data stores. We present a modeldriven architecture (MDA) and method to semi-automate generation of formal rules and extraction of relevant data for compliance checking, based on OMG's MDA methodology. We demonstrate how building a fact-oriented model of the regulation is central to both relating it to the enterprise as well as deriving formal specification of rules. We illustrate our approach using a real-life case study of the MiFID-2 financial regulation.

The development of mutual trust depends on immutable, traceable, and transparent construction quality information records. However, current information technologies cannot meet the requirements. To address the challenge, this study explores a blockchain-based framework for construction quality information management, which extends applications of blockchain in the domain of construction quality management. A consortium blockchain system is designed to support construction quality management in which participants' information permissions and lifecycle are discussed. Additionally, this study presents in detail the consensus process that aims to address the problem of information fraud. The automated compliance checking based on smart contracts is presented as well, aiming to assure that construction products meet regulation requirements. Finally, an example of the consortium blockchain network is visualized to validate the feasibility of blockchain-based construction quality information management. The research shows that blockchain can facilitate mutual trust in construction quality management by providing distributed, encrypted, and secure information records and supporting automated compliance checking of construction quality.

Various commercially-existing automated identification (ID) and information technologies (IT) were used to design a mobile Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) portal for checking the PPE compliance of personnel. When such gates are positioned at the entrance or within construction sites and once low-cost passive RFID tags are embedded or attached to PPE, automatic site access, time recording, and completeness control can be performed. These improve the logistics of the existing compliance checking process and provide users with timely feedback. Results to "personnel entering a construction site" demonstrate how the safety process, especially the awareness among personnel wearing PPE, can be pro-actively managed and controlled. Data further suggests the limitations of the developed approach and its potential for gathering leading safety indicator data. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Lee, H; Lee, JK; Park, S; Kim, I				Lee, Hyunsoo; Lee, Jin-Kook; Park, Seokyung; Kim, Inhan			Translating building legislation into a computer-executable format for evaluating building permit requirements	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building information modeling (BIM); Automated design assessment; Rule checking; Logic rule; Computer-executable form		In this paper, we describe an approach to translating the written content of the Korean Building Act into a computer-executable format for the purpose of evaluating building permit requirements. Among the various applications of building information modeling (BIM), we focus on automated design assessment and its rule making process, which has been performed by both architects and software developers. Compared to the conventional rule-making approach, which is integrated with rule-checking software, our suggested mechanism (KBimLogic) of converting rule sentences from the Korean Building Act into computer-executable code (KBimCode) is a software-independent approach that separates the rule-making and rule-checking processes. We use the rule-making approach to translate the Korean Building Act into an explicit code that focuses on building permit requirements. Building permit-related regulations are defined in the Korean Building Act, but some of the sentences are ambiguous, and some implicit definitions hinder translation into an explicitly defined computer-executable form. Some building permit-related requirements vary by building type, administrative district, permitted date, and as-built date; thus, it is critical to design computable rules independent of specific proprietary software. The building permit system in Korea changes (as it does in other countries), making it critical that code compliance rules be kept up-to-date. Our work is motivated by such fundamentals and suggests a logic rule-based mechanism for use by non-programmers and a user-friendly approach to the rule-making process. The scope and major components of our research are as follows: (1) noun phrases classify building objects and associated properties from the Korean Building Act; (2) verb phrases derive high-level methods to construct the actual rule-checking body; and (3) the logic rule-based mechanism processes natural language sentences. In the actual implementation for translation, this approach has been demonstrated by each database and a GUI-based application named KBimLogic, for generating KBimCode. The KBimCode, which contains a set of specific building permit requirements translated from sentences, can be imported into our code-checking software (KBimAssess) using a specific file format.

The size of data that needs to be checked-the entire world-and data churn rate-thousands per day-makes executing the full set of candidate checks cost prohibitive. Current techniques rely on hand-curated static subsets of checks to be run at different stages of the data production pipeline, These hard-coded subsets are uninformed of data changes, and cause bug detection to be delayed to downstream quality assurance activities. To address these problems, we have developed new representations of map data changes and checks, formally defined "check safety," and built a recommender system that dynamically and automatically selects and ranks a relevant subset of checks using signals from latest data changes. Empirical evaluation shows that it improves (1) efficiency by eliminating 65% of checks unrelated to changes, (2) coverage by recommending and ranking change-related checks from the full set of candidate checks, previously excluded by the manual process, and (3) overall visibility into the data editing process by quickly and automatically identifying latest fault prone parts of the data.

By providing a machine-based checking process the tool ModelCheck was rolled out to meet demands emerged during pilot projecting. Thus it is capable of processing automated compliance checks on quality criteria for the authorities, e. g. documentation guidelines of BBR regarding building and real estate documentation or building information modeling (BIM) quality criteria formed for the Humboldt-Forum project - a BIM pilot-project managed by BBR. ModelCheck supports checks on IFC models - formal against schemes and logical inspection with regards to alpha-numeric content by using xml-based configurable rules.

The use of computational algorithms has traditionally been used by architecture firms but is starting to also grow in popularity throughout mainstream construction for automation of design tasks, as-built analysis, and for creation of parametric models. This paper demonstrates how computational algorithms can be used to support digital twins in construction and how these workflows can be used to converge on optimal and heuristic solutions to challenging problems. Two examples are explored in this paper. The first is a computational algorithm addressed at a complex geometric challenge in the processing of architectural cladding panels for manufacturing. The second example is a computational workflow comprised of algorithms that extract and process metadata in BIM for automated egress path compliance checking. Lessons learned from these examples demonstrate the power of computational algorithms for complex and highly repetitive design processes. Computational algorithms are proven herein to explore large decision space domains efficiently, and pre-emptively catch costly design/analysis errors.

Current compliance checking approaches neglect such information as it is not readily available in process models. Even if ACs are automatically analysed with audit software, the results still need to be linked to related processes. By now, this linking is not methodically supported. To address this gap this paper presents a method to automatically enrich process models with audit relevant information about ACs. The method consists of three phases: process model construction, automated analysis of ACs, and model enrichment. It utilizes two existing artefacts and combines them to provide a comprehensive basis for compliance checking. Moreover, the enriched process models can support auditors in conducting process audits in ERP environments.

Manual loop transformation can be tedious and error-prone, while fully automated methods do not guarantee improvements. Loopy takes a middle path: a programmer specifies a loop transformation at a high level, which is then carried out automatically by Loopy, and formally verified to guard against specification and implementation mistakes. Loopy's notation offers considerable flexibility with assembling transformations, while automation and checking prevent errors. Loopy is implemented for the LLVM framework, building on a polyhedral compilation library. Experiments show substantial improvements over fully automated loop transformations, using simple and direct specifications.

J	Kraemer, FA; Slatten, V; Herrmann, P				Kraemer, Frank Alexander; Slatten, Vidar; Herrmann, Peter			Tool support for the rapid composition, analysis and implementation of reactive services	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Service engineering; Service composition; UML; Model-driven development; Temporal logic; Model checking	MODEL CHECKING	We present the integrated set of tools Arctis for the rapid development of reactive services. In our method, services are composed of collaborative building blocks that encapsulate behavioral patterns expressed as UML 2.0 collaborations and activities. Due to our underlying semantics in temporal logic, building blocks as well as their compositions can be transformed into formulas and model checked incrementally in order to guarantee that important system properties are kept. The process of model checking is fully automated. Error traces are presented to the users as easily understandable animations, so that no expertise in temporal logic is needed. In addition, the results of model checking are analyzed, so that in some cases automated diagnoses and fixes can be provided as well. The formal semantics also enables the correct, automatic synthesis of the activities to state machines which form the input of our code generators. Thus, the collaborative models can be fully automatically transformed into executable Java code. We present the development of a mobile treasure hunt system to exemplify the method and the tools.

J	Shahi, K; McCabe, BY; Shahi, A				Shahi, Kamellia; McCabe, Brenda Y.; Shahi, Arash			Framework for Automated Model-Based e-Permitting System for Municipal Jurisdictions	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article						e-Permitting; Model-based; Building information modeling (BIM); Code compliance checking; GIS integration; Smart urban management; City planning	BUILDINGS; ADOPTION; TRACKING; NETWORK	Recent technological advances in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, including the implementation of building information modeling (BIM) and automated data-capturing tools, have enabled the AEC industry to commence its digital journey in the era of big data. Over the last decade, e-permitting practices have been introduced in many municipal jurisdictions around the world, aimed at replacing the traditional and inefficient paper-based practices. In this paper, these recent international developments are investigated, and three distinct levels of e-permitting are defined based on their varying levels of automation and integration. A framework is then developed that considers the impact of each level of e-permitting on the entire life cycle of the project, from submission of permitting document through construction, operation, and maintenance of the built facility. The developed framework can be used as a road map for any municipality for advancing from traditional paper-based permitting practices (Level 0) to a fully integrated city planning tool (Level 3), thus enabling several smart urban management applications, including city-level planning reviews, integrated logistics planning, and smart urban asset management. The framework as a whole was validated by a group of experts on construction permitting practices. Specific elements of its lower levels have been implemented by municipalities around the world, which have reported significant productivity improvements. Finally, this paper investigates several barriers to implementing the higher levels of e-permitting, along with corresponding strategies for municipalities to mitigate and overcome these challenges.

J	Dimyadi, J; Clifton, C; Spearpoint, M; Amor, R				Dimyadi, Johannes; Clifton, Charles; Spearpoint, Michael; Amor, Robert			Computerizing Regulatory Knowledge for Building Engineering Design	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Regulatory knowledge model; Compliant design procedures; Building compliance model; Automated compliance audit; Building code	MODEL	Two common challenges in the computer-aided compliance audit of building engineering designs are addressed in the current research. The first is to ensure that any form of computable representation is practical and relatively easy to use and maintain. The second is to ensure that performance-based regulatory compliance criteria, which are often qualitative in nature, are adequately addressed and correctly represented. This research proposes a method of automating manual compliant design procedures using an open standard executable workflow representation that can be specified and maintained relatively easily by a design engineer. This executable workflow is referred to as the compliant design procedure (CDP) and can be described graphically. When executed in a computing environment, a CDP can guide the compliance audit process by checking a given design represented in a model view or subset of the building information model (BIM), referred to as the building compliance model (BCM), against the criteria in a digital building code, referred to as the regulatory knowledge model (RKM), which is developed specifically for this purpose. This paper describes the process of modeling and encoding BCM, CDP, and RKM, which are independent input components of the proposed compliance audit system framework. Supplementary human input and the ability to exchange input and output data with external simulation tools to solve some of the more complex qualitative criteria are important features of the framework.

CPC codes have a canonical structure involving successive rounds of bit and phase parity checks, supplemented by cross-checks to fix the code distance. In this paper, we provide a detailed introduction to CPC codes using conventional quantum circuit notation. Wedemonstrate the implementation of a CPC code on real hardware, by designing a [[4, 2, 2]] detection code for the IBM 5Q superconducting qubit device. Whilst the individual gate-error rates on the IBM device are too high to realise a fault tolerant quantum detection code, our results show that the syndrome information from a full encode-decode cycle of the [[4, 2, 2]] CPC code can be used to increase the output state fidelity by post-selection. Following this, we generalise CPC codes to other quantum technologies by showing that their structure allows them to be efficiently compiled using any experimentally realistic native two-qubit gate. Weintroduce a three-stage CPC design process for the construction of hardware-optimised quantum memories. As a proof-of-concept example, we apply our design process to an idealised linear seven-qubit ion trap. In the first stage of the process, we use exhaustive search methods to find a large set of [[7, 3, 3]] codes that saturate the quantum Hamming bound for seven qubits. Wethen optimise over the discovered set of codes to meet the hardware and layout demands of the ion trap device. Wealso discuss how the CPC design process will generalise to larger-scale codes and other qubit technologies.

It focuses on RFPs for large public buildings (over 5 million dollars) in South Korea, which generally entail complex designs. A total of 27 RFPs for housing, office, exhibition, hospital, sports center, and courthouse projects were analyzed to develop computer-interpreted RFP rules. Each RFP was composed of over 1800 sentences. Of these, only three to 366 sentences could be translated into a computer-interpretable sentence. For further analysis, this study deployed context-free grammar (CFG) in natural language processing, and classified morphemes into four categories: i.e., object (noun), method (verb), strictness (modal), and others. The subcategorized morphemes included three types of objects, twenty-nine types of methods, and five levels of strictness. The coverage applicability of the derived objects and methods was checked and validated against three additional RFP cases and then through a test case using a newly developed model checker system. The findings are expected to be useful as a guideline and basic data for system developers in the development of a generalized automated design checking system for South Korea. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

For increasing the accuracy and fineness of assessment, rule interpretations require logical base and standardization of analysis process. Therefore, some government-funded research projects have focused on this rule-making process separated from the rule-checking process. Specifically, KBimLogic is a logic rule-based mechanism designed for the building permit related rules in Korea Building Act sentences. As a com-puter-readable definition of a rule, KBimCode has been developed to be executed in actual rule-checking software. The limitation of such code is the visibility to the rule experts who are usually non-or novice programmers. This paper describes much intuitive way of defining and generating KBimCode through KBim Visual Language. User can easily query the building element and method through the immanent connection with KBimLogic database. By using the KBim Visual Language, various types of rules written in design guideline, international standardization, and national acts can be easily interpreted into computer-readable formats such as KBimCode in order to proceed with the automated rule-checking.

Complex, implicit code clauses are still beyond the scope of such applications. Much research and development is needed for semantic enrichment ( to pre-process models for checking) and for automating checking of complex conditions. A review of the state-of-the-art reveals that research and development has been limited to the application of symbolic AI methods, such as rule inferencing. Based on this review and on a set of early experiments designed to test basic feasibility, the authors propose a framework for research and development that specifically extends current thinking to include machine learning methods for both semantic enrichment and model review. Machine learning is shown to be applicable in situations where expression of the constraints in the form of explicit rules is impractical.

The approach, however, is not yet implemented effectively and efficiently in practice. This research tries to develop a practical DfS approach, which can automatically identify potential safety problems resulted from design by integrating BIM (Building Information Modeling) with design safety rules. Design safety rules related to construction safety is defined and built based on design regulations or codes, and a BIM and safety rules integrated approach developed to implement the automated identification of safety problems. Furthermore, a test-bed project is presented to test the validity of this approach. As a result, the unsafe factors in design can be detected during construction to aid in construction safety management on site. Compared with traditional safety management methods, the BIM-based DfS approach is automated, thus reducing the time and labor cost spent on safety checking and improving the performance of construction safety management.

J	Lee, S; Jeon, H; Park, G; Youn, J				Lee, Sungwon; Jeon, Hyeonkyu; Park, Gihyun; Youn, Jonghee			Design of Automation Environment for Analyzing Various IoT Malware	TEHNICKI VJESNIK-TECHNICAL GAZETTE			English	Article						automated analysis; IoT malware; IoT malware classification; massive malware	SECURITY; INTERNET	With the increasing proliferation of IoT systems, the security of IoT systems has become very important to individuals and businesses. IoT malware has been increasing exponentially since the emergence of Mirai in 2016. Because the IoT system environment is diverse, IoT malware also has various environments. In the case of existing analysis systems, there is no environment for dynamic analysis by running IoT malware of various architectures. It is inefficient in terms of time and cost to build an environment that analyzes malware one by one for analysis. The purpose of this paper is to improve the problems and limitations of the existing analysis system and provide an environment to analyze a large amount of IoT malware. Using existing open source analysis tools suitable for various IoT malicious codes and QEMU, a virtualization software, the environment in which the actual malicious code will run is built, and the library or system call that is actually called is statically and dynamically analyzed. In the text, the analysis system is applied to the actual collected malicious code to check whether it is analyzed and derive statistics. Information on the architecture of malicious code, attack method, command used, and access path can be checked, and this information can be used as a basis for malicious code detection research or classification research. The advantages are described of the system designed compared to the most commonly used automated analysis tools and improvements to existing limitations.

Specifically, we introduce: 1) VeriCoq-IFT, an automated PCHIP framework for information flow policies and 2) VeriCoq-H, a hierarchy-preserving Verilog-to-Coq converter. VeriCoq-IFT aims to: 1) automate the process of converting designs from an HDL to the Coq formal language; 2) generate security property theorems ensuring compliance with information flow policies; 3) construct proofs for such theorems; and 4) check their validity in a design, with minimal user intervention. VeriCoq-H, on the other hand, seeks to convert the entire functionality of a Verilog design to its Coq representation while preserving design hierarchy. It facilitates the development of hierarchical proofs and enables the construction of hybrid module libraries containing the HDL code and the corresponding reusable lemmas for each module. Applicability of our automated VeriCoq-IFT framework is demonstrated by evaluating trustworthiness of two DES encryption circuits and several genuine and Trojan-infested advanced encryption standard (AES) designs, along with the utility of VeriCoq-H in preventing malicious modification of sensitive data, such as the secret key of an encryption circuit.

Starting from the design requirements concerning a base-isolated building, such as the device's stiffness, maximum displacement, and vertical load, as well as the code checks on the device, the procedure allows defining the optimum values of the mechanical and geometrical parameters, such as rubber shear modulus, diameter, and thickness, and the number of rubber and steel layers. In more detail, the procedure allows for first identifying the ranges of the geometrical characteristics through a graphic representation of code checks in terms of the rubber's diameter and volume, and then their specific values that allow one to obtain the optimum solution according to the design requirements for any fixed values of the mechanical characteristics of the materials. The graphic representation represents a suitable tool to better understand the role and influence of the different checks. The procedure can be easily automated by means of a computer code.

J	Holzmann, GJ; Smith, MH				Holzmann, GJ; Smith, MH			An automated verification method for distributed systems software based on model extraction	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Article						formal methods; model checking; software verification; software testing; reactive systems; call processing; feature interaction; case studies		Software verification methods are used only sparingly in industrial software development today, The most successful methods are based on the use of model checking. There are, however, many hurdles to overcome before the use of model checking tools can truly become mainstream. To use a model checker, the user must first define a formal model of the application, and to do so requires specialized knowledge of both the application and of model checking techniques. For larger applications, the effort to manually construct a formal model can take a considerable investment of time and expertise, which can rarely be afforded. Worse, it is hard to secure that a manually constructed model can keep pace with the typical software application, as it evolves from the concept stage to the product stage. In this paper, we describe a verification method that requires far less specialized knowledge in model construction. It allows us to extract models mechanically from source code. The model construction process now becomes easily repeatable, as the application itself continues to evolve. Once the model is constructed, existing model checking techniques allow us to perform all checks in a mechanical fashion, achieving nearly complete automation. The level of thoroughness that can be achieved with this new type of software testing is significantly greater than for conventional techniques. We report on the application of this method in the verification of the call processing software for a new telephone switch that was recently developed at Lucent Technologies.

J	Song, J; Lee, JK; Choi, J; Kim, I				Song, Jaeyeol; Lee, Jin-Kook; Choi, Jungsik; Kim, Inhan			Deep learning-based extraction of predicate-argument structure (PAS) in building design rule sentences	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL DESIGN AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						automated rule checking; building information modeling (BIM); natural language processing (NLP); predicate argument structure	CHECKING; BIM; SYSTEM	This paper describes an approach to extracting a predicate-argument structure (PAS) in building design rule sentences using natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning models. For the computer to reason about the compliance of building design, design rules represented by natural language must be converted into a computer-readable format. The rule interpretation and translation processes are challenging tasks because of the vagueness and ambiguity of natural language. Many studies have proposed approaches to address this problem, but most of these are dependent on manual tasks, which is the bottleneck to expanding the scope of design rule checking to design requirements from various documents. In this paper, we apply deep learning-based NLP techniques for translating design rule sentences into a computer-readable data structure. To apply deep learning-based NLP techniques to the rule interpretation process, we identified the semantic role elements of building design requirements and defined a PAS for design rule checking. Using a bidirectional long short-term memory model with a conditional random field layer, the computer can intelligently analyze constituents of building design rule sentences and automatically extract the logical elements.

In contrast, classical verification tools, based on automated theorem-provers for first-order logic, are well established as supporting program verification without any manual proof steps. However, there is a price to pay: program verifiers are large, complex bodies of code, and believing their outputs requires believing in much more than the correct implementation of Coq's proof-checking kernel. In this tutorial, I will demonstrate how to use the Bedrock Coq library to get the best of both worlds. Our focus will be on the kinds of programs with the most tedious detail and the most opportunity to benefit from automation: namely, those written in assembly language. I will show how to build automated correctness proofs of simple imperative data structures, while dealing with first-class code pointers and producing Coq proof terms for theorems whose statements depend on little beyond operational semantics of machine code.

A Clustering Approach for Analyzing the Computability of Building Code Requirements	CONSTRUCTION RESEARCH CONGRESS 2018: CONSTRUCTION INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY			English	Proceedings Paper	Construction Research Congress	APR 02-04, 2018	Louisiana State Univ, Bert S Turner Dept Construct Management, New Orleans, LA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Construct Inst, Construct Res Council, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Construct Inst	Louisiana State Univ, Bert S Turner Dept Construct Management			Automated code compliance checking has been implemented using a variety of different methods. These methods vary widely in terms of automation level, expressivity, representativeness, accuracy, and efficiency. Although most of the existing methods/tools are similar in that they represent the code requirements in the form of rules, the semantic representation and language/format they use for rule representation vary from a method/tool to another. One common limitation of all these methods/tools is the inability to fully represent all types of requirements (e.g., requirements that are too complex or that require human judgment by nature). More research is, thus, needed to better identify what the different types of requirements are-in terms of their semantics and syntactics-and which of them could be represented in a computer-processable form. To address this need, this paper proposes a new methodology for identifying the different types of building code requirements in terms of computability. The proposed methodology consists of three primary tasks: (1) use a machine-learning clustering algorithm to identify the computational clusters of the code requirements, (2) identify the different types of requirements in the different clusters, in terms of their semantic and syntactic features and structures, complexity, etc., and (3) determine the computability of different sentence types. The proposed methodology was implemented and tested on a corpus of sentences from the 2015 International Building Code. The paper discusses the clustering and analysis methodology and results.

When using the model checker tool NuSMV, people have to program the code for the model they built firstly. During the course of programming with the input language of NuSMV, for non-expert users, some manual mistakes may be brought in such as making syntax errors or omitting some transfer conditions etc. This paper introduces a tool XMI2SMV which is an automatic generator to be used to generate NuSMV programming codes for XMI files. This tool aims to bridge between a UML tool and the model checker tool NuSMV. We just need build our behavioral system model using a UML tool and export its corresponding XMI file, and this tool can help us to generate NuSMV code automatically, avoiding manual errors.

J	Kim, K; Teizer, J				Kim, Kyungki; Teizer, Jochen			Automatic design and planning of scaffolding systems using building information modeling	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Building information modeling; Design and construction planning; Geometric reasoning for automated modeling; Rules and regulations; Safety; Temporary facilities (scaffolding systems)	REPRESENTATION; RECOGNITION; CHECKING; SPACE	Considering their significant impact on construction projects, scaffolding as part of the temporary facilities category in construction must be thoroughly designed, planned, procured, and managed. The current practices in planning and managing scaffolding though is often manual and reactive, especially when a construction project is already underway. Widespread results are code compliance problems, inefficiency, and waste of procuring and managing material for scaffolding systems. We developed a rule-based system that automatically plans scaffolding systems for pro-active management in Building Information Modeling (BIM). The scope of the presented work is limited to traditional pipe and board scaffolding systems. A rule was prepared based on the current practice of planning and installing scaffolding systems. Our computational algorithms automatically recognize geometric and non-geometric conditions in building models and produce a scaffolding system design which a practitioner can use in the field. We implemented our automated scaffolding system for a commercially-available BIM software and tested it in a case study project. The system thoroughly identified the locations in need of scaffolding and generated the corresponding scaffolding design in BIM. Further results show, the proposed approach successfully generated a scaffolding system-loaded BIM model that can be utilized in communication, billing of materials, scheduling simulation, and as a benchmark for accurate field installation and performance measurement.

J	Siddula, M; Dai, F; Ye, YF; Fan, JP				Siddula, Madhuri; Dai, Fei; Ye, Yanfang; Fan, Jianping			Classifying construction site photos for roof detection A machine-learning method towards automated measurement of safety performance on roof sites	CONSTRUCTION INNOVATION-ENGLAND			English	Article						Construction management; Construction safety; Health and safety; Machine learning; Image-based methods; Roofing industry	OBJECT DETECTION; SAMPLE-SIZE; RECOGNITION; FEATURES; IMAGES; SPACE; COLOR; SVM	Purpose - Roofing is one of the most dangerous jobs in the construction industry. Due to factors such as lack of planning, training and use of precaution, roofing contractors and workers continuously violate the fall protection standards enforced by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration. A preferable way to alleviate this situation is automating the process of non-compliance checking of safety standards through measurements conducted in site daily accumulated videos and photos. As a key component, the purpose of this paper is to devise a method to detect roofs in site images that is indispensable for such automation process. Design/methodology/approach - This method represents roof objects through image segmentation and visual feature extraction. The visual features include colour, texture, compactness, contrast and the presence of roof corner. A classification algorithm is selected to use the derived representation for statistical learning and detection. Findings - The experiments led to detection accuracy of 97.50 per cent, with over 15 per cent improvement in comparison to conventional classifiers, signifying the effectiveness of the proposed method. Research limitations/implications - This study did not test on images of roofs in the following conditions: roofs initially built without apparent appearance (e.g. structural roof framing completed and undergoing the sheathing process) and flat, barrel and dome roofs. From a standpoint of construction safety, while the present work is vital, coupling with semantic representation and analysis is still needed to allow for risk analysis of fall violations on roof sites. Originality/value - This study is the first to address roof detection in site images. Its findings provide a basis to enable semantic representation of roof site objects of interests (e.g. co-existence and correlation among roof site, roofer, guardrail and personal fall arrest system) that is needed to automate the non-compliance checking of safety standards on roof sites.

J	Zhou, P; El-Gohary, N				Zhou, Peng; El-Gohary, Nora			Ontology-Based Multilabel Text Classification of Construction Regulatory Documents	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								In order to fully automate the environmental regulatory compliance checking process, rules should be automatically extracted from applicable environmental regulatory textual documents, such as energy conservation codes. In the authors' automated compliance checking (ACC) approach, prior to rule extraction, the text is first classified into predefined categories to only retrieve relevant clauses and filter out irrelevant ones, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of rule extraction. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been commonly used for text classification (TC). Nonontology-based, ML-based TC has, generally, performed well. However, given the need for an exceptionally high performance in TC to support high performance in ACC, further TC performance improvement is needed. To address this need, an ontology-based TC algorithm is proposed to further improve the classification performance by utilizing the semantic features of the text. A domain ontology for conceptualizing the environmental knowledge was used. The proposed ontology-based TC algorithm was tested on 25 environmental regulatory documents, evaluated using four evaluation metrics, and compared with the authors' previously utilized ML-based approach. Based on the testing data, the results show that the ontology-based approach consistently outperformed the ML-based approach, under all evaluation metrics.

For large software projects checking out the source code, building the product and testing the product build via automated tests during CI can take a long time (e.g. many hours). So the software developers do not get fast feedback about their changes. Often the test report contains the results of many changes from several software developers or the feedback is not accurate enough according to the developer's source code changes. This paper describes a novel approach to reduce the feedback time and to provide test results for only these changes the developer has committed.

In this paper, we explore the feasibility of verifying "almost unmodified" software middleboxes. Our key observation is that software middleboxes are already designed and implemented in a modular way (e.g., Click). Further, to achieve high performance, the number of operations each element or module performs is finite and small. These two characteristics place them within reach of automated verification through symbolic execution. We perform a systematic study to test how many existing Click elements can be automatically verified using symbolic execution. We show that 45% of the elements can be automatically verified and an additional 33% of Click elements can be automatically verified with slight code modifications. To allow automated verification, we build Gravel, a software middlebox verification framework. Gravel allows developers to specify high-level middlebox properties and checks correctness in the implementation without requiring manual proofs. We then use Gravel to specify and verify middlebox-specific properties for several Click-based middleboxes. Our evaluation shows that Gravel avoids bugs that are found in today's middleboxes with minimal code changes and that the code modifications needed for proof automation do not affect middlebox performance.

LEVELS OF BIM COMPLIANCE FOR MODEL HANDOVER	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building Information Modelling (BIM); Facilities Management (FM); compliance review; owner requirements; model handover	BUILDING INFORMATION	The important process of design review, compliance checking and project handover information intake and processing have traditionally been paper based and manual tasks. These tasks are onerous and error prone. Moreover, they do not allow effective detection of design issues and validation of project information quality for handover which lead to waste of resources when performing maintenance and repairs during operations. Building Information Modeling has the potential to help owners overcome these challenges by enabling seamless exchange of project information between design, construction, and operations while supporting and proving opportunities for automated design reviews. However, this practice has yet to fully take root in the industry due to its relative novelty. The research project presented in this paper set out to understand how owners could adopt and implement BIM to support design and information handover review. Two large public owner organizations were investigated over five years to support this aim. The findings are articulated around three levels of compliance for the owner's project and BIM requirements. The findings on compliance review suggest three elements: model structure verification, model content verification and design compliance review. These three elements rely on model queries which are identified through investigation of owner's operational requirements. The presented research connects modeling practice to support facilities maintenance, owner's information requirements, and owner's design requirements and leverages this information for model based compliance review.

J	Bloch, T; Sacks, R				Bloch, Tanya; Sacks, Rafael			Comparing machine learning and rule-based inferencing for semantic enrichment of BIM models	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building information modeling; Semantic enrichment; Machine learning	CLASSIFICATION; CONSTRUCTION; DESIGN; SPACE	The need for extensive pre-processing to prepare model data for sophisticated BIM applications, such as automated code compliance checking, functional simulation and analysis, and information exchange, is a major obstacle to their use. Semantic enrichment offers an alternative, automated approach to manual pre-processing. We illustrate the use of machine learning algorithms for semantic enrichment of BIM models, and compare it to rule-inferencing, through application to the problem of classification of room types in residential apartments. The results showed that machine learning is directly applicable to the space classification problem. Although rule-inferencing has succeeded in other contexts, it proved to be unsuitable for this problem. This leads to the observation that different BIM object classification problems require different approaches. More generally speaking, the Al methods used for semantic enrichment depend on the nature of the problem context, and future research will be needed to establish suitable guidelines.

Using this MC68020 specification, we have mechanically checked the correctness of MC68020 machine code programs for Euclid's GCD, Hoare's Quick Sort, binary search, and other well-known algorithms. The machine code for these examples was generated using the Gnu C and the Verdix Ada compilers.

Traditional validation approaches based on simulation become obsolete in reconfigurable manufacturing systems where complex machines have decentralized control and are built by reuse of components. The source code based validation is also important for OEMs to unify their development procedures from embedded systems to machine controllers. For modeling the VFL design we used Net Condition/Event systems (NCES) - a modular formalism developed for modeling systems with distributed states such as closed-loop control systems in distributed mechatronic devices. The methodology was implemented in software tools automatically generating the model's modules given the controller's source code. Then the hierarchical NCES model is assembled into a place/transition net that is subjected to model checking. The proposed approach facilitates integration of formal validation into software/hardware development in control systems' engineering.

Applications and extensions of Alloy: past, present and future	MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article							MODEL CHECKING; SPECIFICATIONS; THEOREM	Alloy is a declarative language for lightweight modelling and analysis of software. The core of the language is based on first-order relational logic, which offers an attractive balance between analysability and expressiveness. The logic is expressive enough to capture the intricacies of real systems, but is also simple enough to support fully automated analysis with the Alloy Analyzer. The Analyzer is built on a SAT-based constraint solver and provides automated simulation, checking and debugging of Alloy specifications. Because of its automated analysis and expressive logic, Alloy has been applied in a wide variety of domains. These applications have motivated a number of extensions both to the Alloy language and to its SAT-based analysis. This paper provides an overview of Alloy in the context of its three largest application domains, lightweight modelling, bounded code verification and test-case generation, and three recent application-driven extensions, an imperative extension to the language, a compiler to executable code and a proof-capable analyser based on SMT.

Since weaknesses in hash functions may imply vulnerabilities in the constructions that build upon them, ensuring their security is essential. Unfortunately, many widely used hash functions, including SHA-1 and MD5, are subject to practical attacks. The search for a secure replacement is one of the most active topics in the field of cryptography. In this paper we report on the first machine-checked and independently-verifiable proofs of collision-resistance and indifferentiability of Merkle-Damgard, a construction that underlies many existing hash functions. Our proofs are built and verified using an extension of the EasyCrypt framework, which relies on state-of-the-art verification tools such as automated theorem provers, SMT solvers, and interactive proof assistants.

Code weaknesses range from security vulnerabilities, logic errors, concurrency violations, to improper resource usage, violations of architectures or coding guidelines. Common to all code analysis techniques is that they build abstractions of code and then check those abstractions for properties of interest. For instance a type checker computes how types are used, abstract interpreters and symbolic evaluators check how values flow, model checkers analyze how state evolves. Building modern program analysis tools thus requires a multi-pronged approach to find a variety of weaknesses. In this talk I will discuss and compare several program analysis tools, which MSR build during the last ten years. They include theorem provers, program verifiers, bug finders, malware scanners, and test case generators. I will describe the need for their development, their innovation, and application. Many of these tools had considerable impact on Microsoft's development practices, as well as on the research community. Some of them are being shipped in products such as the Static Driver Verifier or as part of Visual Studio. Performing program analysis as part of quality assurance is meanwhile standard practice in many software development companies. However several challenges have not yet been resolved. Thus, I will conclude with a set of open challenges in program analysis which hopefully triggers new aspiring directions in our joint quest of delivering predictable software that is free from defect and vulnerabilities.									0	1	1	0	1	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA	0270-5257		978-1-4673-1067-3	PROC INT CONF SOFTW			2012							1001	1001					1	Computer Science, Software Engineering; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BDE03	WOS:000312908700099					2021-09-17

The paper focuses on logic simulation: stimuli are provided to execute all the line of the HDL code. To accomplish the verification, a test-bench is built to provide scenarios to be checked. The simulation environment consists in: generator (generates inputs), drivers (translate the stimuli provided by the generator into inputs for the design under verification), score-boards database to be checked and different metrics of coverage. The case study presented in the paper uses Specman Elite as software tool for the verification environment and VCS as simulator.

Using this formal description, we have mechanically checked the correctness of MC68020 object code programs for binary search, Hoare's Quick Sort, twenty-one functions from the Berkeley Unix C string library, and other well-known algorithms. The object code for these examples was generated using the Gnu C, the Verdix Ada, and the Gnu Common Lisp compilers. We have mechanized a mathematical theory to facilitate automated reasoning about object code programs. We describe a two-stage methodology we use to do our proofs.

Integrating Natural Language Processing and Spatial Reasoning for Utility Compliance Checking	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Underground utility; Compliance checking; Natural language processing (NLP); Spatial reasoning; Geographical information system (GIS); Information technologies	INFORMATION; CLASSIFICATION; SYSTEM; BIM	Underground utility incidents, such as utility conflicts and utility strikes, result in time and cost overruns in construction projects, property damages, environmental pollution, personnel injuries, and fatalities. A main cause of recurrent utility incidents is the noncompliance with the spatial configurations between utilities and their surroundings. Utility specifications usually contain textual descriptions of the spatial configurations. However, detection of spatial defects, according to the textual descriptions, is difficult and time consuming. This deficiency is because of the lack of spatial cognition in many rule-checking systems to process massive amounts of data. This study aims to automate utility compliance checking by integrating natural language processing (NLP) and spatial reasoning. NLP algorithm translates the textual descriptions of spatial configurations into computer-processable spatial rules. Spatial reasoning executes the extracted spatial rules following a logical order in a geographical information system (GIS) to identify noncompliance. The intellectual contribution of this study is twofold. First, complex spatial rules are retrieved automatically from textual data with their hierarchies classified, which provides the inputs and indicates the sequence of rule execution in spatial reasoning. Second, semantic spatial relations are modeled on the basis of their metric and topological implications, enabling the automatic execution of multiple spatial rules. Experiments were conducted to test this framework. The average precision, recall, and combination of the two (F-measure) achieved by the NLP algorithm for extracting spatial rules are 87.88%, 79.09%, and 83.25%, respectively. In addition, the spatial reasoning mechanism also was found to be a powerful tool for compliance checking under various scenarios.

For each control system to be generated, the user makes a description of the application-specific parameters in a domain-specific language. This description is automatically transformed into an executable control system model expressed in SystemC. This model is then compiled into object code. Verification is performed using four main methods applied to different levels: (0) The domain-specific description is validated wrt. internal consistency by static analysis. (1) The crucial safety properties are verified for the SystemC model by means of bounded model checking. (2) The object code is verified to be I/O behavioural equivalent to the SystemC model from which it was compiled. (3) The correctness of the hardware /software integration is checked by automated testing.

Verifying spacecraft flight software to assure that it operates correctly and safely is presently an intensive and costly process. A multitude of scenarios and tests must be devised, executed and reviewed to provide reasonable confidence that the software will perform as intended and not endanger the spacecraft. Undetected software defects on spacecraft and launch vehicles have caused embarrassing and costly failures in recent years. Model checking is a technique for software verification that can detect concurrency defects that are otherwise difficult to discover. Within appropriate constraints, a model checker can perform an exhaustive state-space search on a software design or implementation and alert the implementing organization to potential design deficiencies. Unfortunately, model checking of large software systems requires an often-too-substantial effort in developing and maintaining the software functional models. A recent development in this area, however, promises to enable software-implementing organizations to take advantage of the usefulness of model checking without hand-built functional models. This development is the appearance of "model extractors." A model extractor permits the automated and repeated testing of code as built rather than of separate design models. This allows model checking to be used without the overhead and perils involved in maintaining separate models. We have attempted to apply model checking to legacy flight software from NASA's Deep Space One (DS1) mission. This software was implemented in C and contained some known defects at launch that are detectable with a model checker. We will describe the model checking process, the tools used, and the methods and conditions necessary to successfully perform model checking on the DS1 flight software.

This composition can be described from both a local or a global perspective by respective orchestration or choreography. In fact, the main focus of this paper is to validate a web service orchestration through the verification of properties. This verification must take into account both generic and specific properties. The generic properties can be checked for any invoked web services when the specific properties are different interdependence relationships between activities within an orchestration process. These properties cannot be directly verified on the process, so, we have to use formal techniques. Doing so, we will present, in this paper, our formal approach to validate a web service orchestration. The paper adopts WS-BPEL 2.0 as the language to describe the web service orchestration and uses the SPIN model-checker for the verification engine. The WS-BPEL specification is translated into Promela code which is the input language for SPIN model-checker, in order to check generic and specific properties expressed with LTL (Linear Temporal Logic). A tool named BPELVT (BPEL Verification Tool) is developed to support the proposed approach. It provides the WS-BPEL manager, the automated process translation of WS-BPEL to Promela code and model-checking views.

It has been used for compiling domain-specific languages and automating tedious and error-prone specializations of high-performance computational kernels. By statically ensuring that the generated code compiles and letting us quickly run it, MetaOCaml makes writing generators less daunting and more productive. The current BER MetaOCaml is a complete re-implementation of the original MetaOCaml by Taha, Calcagno and collaborators. Besides the new organization, new algorithms, new code, BER MetaOCaml adds a scope extrusion check superseding environment classifiers. Attempting to build code values with unbound or mistakenly bound variables (liable to occur due to mutation or other effects) is now caught early, raising an exception with good diagnostics. The guarantee that the generated code always compiles becomes unconditional, no matter what effects were used in generating the code. We describe BER MetaOCaml stressing the design decisions that made the new code modular and maintainable. We explain the implementation of the scope extrusion check.

The platform can establish the types of location patterns of lap splices (called lapping patterns) for the longitudinal reinforcements; calculate the length of every reinforcement; arrange the same sized reinforcements by length in decreasing order; choose the proper stock lengths for bar cutting; and determine the best lapping pattern with optimal stock length by the trial and error method or the linear programming approach, which can yield the most economical way to supply a proper stock length for cutting. Finally, the platform can automatically generate the shop drawing and schedule the reinforcements, which may be very useful for building construction and management.

Parties' actions influence the status of a contract and shall comply with its clauses. Manual contract monitoring is very laborious in real markets, such as transactive energy, where plenty of complex contracts are running concurrently. Furthermore, liability, right and performance transition through run-time operations such as subcontracting, assignment and substitution complicate contract interpretation. Automation is needed to ensure that contracts respect desirable properties and to support monitoring of compliance and handling of violations. In this thesis research, I propose an innovative ontology that defines fundamental contractual notions (such as the ones mentioned above) and their relationships, on which is built a specification language, called Symboleo, that provides syntax and axiomatic semantics of contracts via first-order logic. Symboleo enables the development of advanced automation tools such as a compliance checker that monitors contracts at run-time, and a model checking verification method that analyzes liveness and safety properties of contracts. This paper reports on the problem domain, research method, current status, expected contributions, and main foreseen challenges.

The data flow itself could be a bottleneck particularly where U.S. intelligence assets and facilities must share information with multinational coalitions. The bottleneck could be reduced by replacing the difficult manual check at the time of release with many simpler and mostly automated checks that are scattered throughout the data production process. However, conventional release processes, which are implemented using COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) systems, are susceptible to malicious code that could easily subvert these checks. This paper describes the Releasable Data Products Framework (RDPF), a collection of building blocks that when augmented with COTS release systems, can protect the data production process and can provide the release officer with assurance that only those data produced in an approved and secure manner are released.

Advertising and information signs on building facades are one of the types of outdoor advertising. As a rule, there are laws and design codes in cities that define permissible look of such signs. At the same time, in metropolises, there is a problem of timely detection of advertising constructions on facades that violate these rules. City-scale monitoring of facade conditions is beyond the capabilities of any city's authorities. To address this issue, we propose a solution which combines street-view maps and machine learning to automate the process of searching for law-breaking advertising objects on building facades. We develop a dataset for a machine learning model and a set of checks for detected advertising objects to check their legality. The resulting approach can provide data for future research and help maintain coherent urban visual environment. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To address the "state explosion" problem associated with this technique, we propose to integrate assume-guarantee verification at different phases of system development. During design, developers build abstract behavioral models of the system components and use them to establish key properties of the system. To increase the scalability of model checking at this level, we have previously developed techniques that automatically decompose the verification task by generating component assumptions for the properties to hold The design artifacts are subsequently used to guide the implementation of the system, but also to enable more efficient reasoning of the source code. In particular, we propose to use assumptions generated for the design to similarly decompose the verification of the actual system implementation. We demonstrate our approach on a significant NASA application, where design models were used to identify and correct a safety property violation, and the generated assumptions allowed us to check successfully that the property was preserved by the implementation.

J	Memon, A; Nagarajan, A; Xie, Q				Memon, A; Nagarajan, A; Xie, Q			Automating regression testing for evolving GUI software	JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE AND EVOLUTION-RESEARCH AND PRACTICE			English	Article						GUI regression testing; GUI testing; smoke testing; daily/nightly builds; event-flow graphs; graphical user interfaces; software quality	SMOKE	With the widespread deployment of broadband connections worldwide, software development and maintenance are increasingly being performed by multiple engineers, often working around-the-clock to maximize code churn rates. To ensure rapid quality assurance of such software, techniques such as 'nightly/daily building and smoke testing' have become widespread since they often reveal bugs early in the software development process. During these builds, a development version of the software is checked out from the source code repository tree, compiled, linked, and (re)tested with the goal of (re)validating its basic functionality. Although successful for conventional software, smoke tests are difficult to develop and automatically re-run for software that has a graphical user interface (GUI). In this paper, we describe a framework called DART (Daily Automated Regression Tester) that addresses the needs of frequent and automated re-testing of GUI software. The key to our success is automation: DART automates everything from structural GUI analysis, smoke-test-case generation, test-oracle creation, to code instrumentation, test execution, coverage evaluation, regeneration of test cases, and their re-execution. Together with the operating system's task scheduler, DART can execute frequently with little input from the developer/tester to re-test the GUI software. We provide results of experiments showing the time taken and memory required for GUI analysis, test case and test oracle generation, and test execution. We empirically compare the relative costs of employing different levels of detail in the GUI test oracle. We also show the events and statements covered by the smoke test cases.

Recent efforts in the area of augmented data analytics have proposed the use of templates to facilitate the analysis of text. However, most of these efforts have constructed such templates manually, which is labor-intensive. More importantly, it is difficult for manually-developed templates to capture the linguistic variations in building codes. More research is, thus, needed to automate the generation of templates to support the tagging and extraction of information from building codes. To address this need, this paper proposes an unsupervised machine-learning based method to extract sentence templates that describe syntactic and semantic features and patterns from building codes. The proposed method is composed of four main steps: (1) data preprocessing; (2) identifying the different groups of sentence fragments using clustering; (3) identifying the fixed parts and the slots in the templates based on the syntactic and semantic patterns of the sentence fragment groups; and (4) evaluating the extracted templates. The proposed method was implemented and tested on a corpus of text from the International Building Code. An accuracy of 0.76 was achieved.

Unfortunately, ATN is not widely adopted because of the complexity and multiformity of negotiation policies, especially in virtual computing environment, where the situation becomes worse than in traditional computing environment, due to the fact that a host with multiple virtual machines needs to be deployed with multiple negotiation policies. Moreover, all of these policies for each virtual machine must be upgraded and checked. To ease the burden on the administrator when deploying ATN access control policies and credentials in virtual computing environment, we propose an automated trusted negotiation architecture called virtual automated trust negotiation (VATN) to centralize ATN policies and credentials for multiple virtual machines in a physical node into a privileged virtual machine. VATN puts policy compliance checker and credential verification control in each virtual machine to improve the execution efficiency of trust negotiation. We implement VATN in Xen virtualization platform. Finally, we discuss the correctness of policy consistency checking and make performance analysis of VATN implemented in Xen.

It enables to develop system models from reusable building blocks, formal analysis by model checking as well as automated transformation to executable code. In this paper, we describe an extension of the SPACE formalism which allows to model and verify also real-time behavior. In particular, one specifies real-time constraints in the interface descriptions of the building blocks, so-called Real-Time External State-Machines (RTESMs). The RTESMs are translated to guards, clocks and invariants of Timed Automata which can be analyzed by means of the model checker UPPAAL. The approach is explained by a component protecting an electrical motor controller system against overspeed. In particular, we prove that by keeping certain maximum response times, this system guarantees that the speed of the motor stays within certain limits.

Finding unusual code	2007 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE	Proceedings-IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance		English	Proceedings Paper	23rd IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance	OCT 02-05, 2007	Paris, FRANCE	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE France Sect, TCSE, IEEE Comp Soc, Tech Council Software Engn, Reeng Forum, Univ Waterloo, Univ Studi Sannio				We describe an automated approach to finding code fragments that are unusual and hence might represent potential problems. Many potential problems in programs arise in code that is uncommon either because it represents rarely used constructs and hence is unfamiliar to the programmer, or because it represents a mistyping or other error that still happens to be legal code, albeit not very common. We present an approach that first finds what is "unusual" by reading a corpus of code and building a library of common patterns. The approach can then take any existing program and check if it contains any unusual patterns. We have run the system using a large corpus and have identified problems in a number of sample projects with otherwise working code.

Consisting of more than one million lines of Fortran 95 code, the application is tested for correctness with a set of about 2,500 inputs using a dedicated regression testing environment. CP2K can be built with many compilers and executed on different serial and parallel platforms, thus making comprehensive testing even more challenging. This paper presents an effort to improve the existing testing process of CP2K in order to better support its continuing development. Enhancements have been made to the regression testing environment to support multi-platform testing and a new automated multi-platform testing system has been developed to check the code on a regular basis. Also, tools have been used to gain code coverage information for different test configurations. All the information is aggregated and displayed on the dedicated web page.

Through the GDPR, individuals are able to better control their personal data in the face of new technological developments. While the GDPR is highly advantageous to individuals, complying with it poses major challenges for organizations that control or process personal data. Since no automated solution with broad industrial applicability currently exists for GDPR compliance checking, organizations have no choice but to perform costly manual audits to ensure compliance. In this paper, we share our experience building a UML representation of the GDPR as a first step towards the development of future automated methods for assessing compliance with the GDPR. Given that a concrete implementation of the GDPR is affected by the national laws of the EU member states, GDPR's expanding body of case law and other contextual information, we propose a two-tiered representation of the GDPR: a generic tier and a specialized tier. The generic tier captures the concepts and principles of the GDPR that apply to all contexts, whereas the specialized tier describes a specific tailoring of the generic tier to a given context, including the contextual variations that may impact the interpretation and application of the GDPR. We further present the challenges we faced in our modeling endeavor, the lessons we learned from it, and future directions for research.

SymNet injects symbolic packets and tracks their evolution through the network. Our key novelty is SEFL, a language we designed for expressing data plane processing in a symbolic-execution friendly manner. SymNet statically analyzes an abstract data plane model that consists of the SEFL code for every node and the links between nodes. SymNet can check networks containing routers with hundreds of thousands of prefixes and NATs in seconds, while verifying packet header memory-safety and covering network functionality such as dynamic tunneling, stateful processing and encryption. We used SymNet to debug middle-box interactions from the literature, to check properties of our department's network and the Stanford backbone. Modeling network functionality is not easy. To aid users we have developed parsers that automatically generate SEFL models from router and switch tables, firewall configurations and arbitrary Click modular router configurations. The parsers rely on prebuilt models that are exact and fast to analyze. Finally, we have built an automated testing tool that combines symbolic execution and testing to check whether the model is an accurate representation of the real code.

The primary goal of legal policy simulation is predicting how changes in the law affect measures of interest, e.g., revenue. Legal policy simulation is currently implemented using a combination of spreadsheets and software code. Such a direct implementation poses a validation challenge. In particular, legal experts often lack the necessary software background to review complex spreadsheets and code. Consequently, these experts currently have no reliable means to check the correctness of simulations against the requirements envisaged by the law. A further challenge is that representative data for simulation may be unavailable, thus necessitating a data generator. A hard-coded generator is difficult to build and validate. We develop a framework for legal policy simulation that is aimed at addressing the challenges above. The framework uses models for specifying both legal policies and the probabilistic characteristics of the underlying population. We devise an automated algorithm for simulation data generation. We evaluate our framework through a case study on Luxembourg's Tax Law.

J	Nahangi, M; Haas, CT				Nahangi, Mohammad; Haas, Carl T.			Automated 3D compliance checking in pipe spool fabrication	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Point cloud registration; As-built status; Laser scanning; Staged fabrication; Quality assessment	IMAGE REGISTRATION METHODS; PROGRESS MEASUREMENT; CAD MODEL; CONSTRUCTION; SIMULATION; QUALITY; RECONSTRUCTION; VISUALIZATION; IMPACT; ERROR	In pipe spool assemblies used in construction, pre-fabrication errors inevitably occur due to the complexity of the tasks involved in the pipe spool fabrication process, the inaccuracy of the tools employed for performing these tasks, human error, and inadequate inspection and monitoring,during the process. Permanent deflections may also occur during shipment and transportation. After delivery at construction sites, defective spools must be detected and further consideration given to the erection of the spools to tolerance levels specified; otherwise, the repair and realignment associated with rework can cause schedule delays and consequent substantial costs increases. This paper presents an automated approach for monitoring and assessing fabricated pipe spools using automated scan-to-BIM registration. Defects are detected through a neighborhood-based Iterative Closest Point (ICP) approach for the registration process. While this technique can be broadly employed, this paper focuses on industrial construction facilities with particular emphasis on pipe spool assemblies. Experiments show that the proposed approach can be employed for the automatic and continual monitoring of such assemblies throughout fabrication, assembly and erection to enable timely detection and characterization of deviations. The main contribution of the work presented in this paper is an automated 3D inspection framework and algorithms for construction assemblies in general and pipe spools in particular.

Automated optimization of steel reinforcement in RC building frames using building information modeling and hybrid genetic algorithm	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Building information modeling; Industry foundation classes; Reinforced concrete design; Structural optimization; Steel reinforcement	CONCRETE FRAMES; DESIGN; COLONY; BIM	Design of steel reinforcement is an important and necessary task for designing reinforced concrete (RC) building structures. Currently, steel reinforcement design is performed manually or semi-automatically using computer software such as ETABS, with reference to building codes. These approaches are time consuming and sometimes error-prone. Recent advances in building information modeling (BIM) technology allow digital 3D BIM models to be leveraged for supporting different types of engineering analyses such as structural engineering design. With the aid of BIM technology, steel reinforcement design could be automated for fast, economical and error-free procedures. This paper presents a BIM-based framework using the developed three-stage hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) for automated optimization of steel reinforcement in RC frames. The methodology framework determines the selection and alignment of steel reinforcement bars in an RC building frame for the minimum steel reinforcement area, considering longitudinal tensile, longitudinal compressive and shear steel reinforcement. The first two stages optimize the longitudinal tensile and longitudinal compressive steel reinforcement while the third stage optimizes the shear steel reinforcement. International design code (BS8110) and buildability constraints are considered in the developed optimization framework. A BIM model in Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is then automatically created to visualize the optimized steel reinforcement design results in 3D thereby facilitating design communication and generation of construction detailing drawings. A three-storey RC building frame is analyzed to check the applicability of the developed framework and its improvement over current design approaches. The results show that the developed methodology framework can minimize the steel reinforcement area quickly and accurately.	[Mangal, Mohit; Cheng, Jack C.

C	Qu, MC; Cui, NG; Zhang, YN; Wu, XH				Qu, Ming-Cheng; Cui, Nai-Gang; Zhang, Ya-Nan; Wu, Xiang-Hu			Unstructured Error Check and Automatic Code Generation for Flowchart	ADVANCED SCIENCE LETTERS			English	Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Advances Technology in Telecommunication, Broadcasting, and Satellite (TelSaTech)	SEP 26-27, 2015	Jakarta, INDONESIA			Automatic Code Generation; Structured Flowchart; Unstructured Flowchart; Structural Feature Recognition; Eclipse		Model-Driven Software Development (MDD) and Automated Software Engineering (AUSE) have achieved widespread attention and rapid development. Automatic code generation based on model is one of the most key technologies for MDD and AUSE. In recent years, a number of tools are capable of generating code based on UML or other specific graphics, such as Rhapsody, B4F, Matlab, Win A&D, etc. These tools mostly use state diagram, class diagram, data flow diagram, block diagram for system modeling, and can automatically generate software framework code. But they all lack effective ability of graphic description and code generation for detailed processing procedure or algorithm logic. Structured flowchart has been widely used in software requirements, design and testing phases. Rhapsody has the ability to build flowchart and generate code, but it does not check whether a given flowchart is correct or structural, it will randomly generate 'goto' statements for the error or non-structural features. We proposed three algorithms, i.e., structure feature recognition and code generation O(n) algorithms, error and unstructured feature recognition O(n) algorithm. After a theoretical proof, application development and testing, and comparative analysis with existing tools, the effectiveness, accuracy and advance of the proposed algorithms were proved fully.

This study reviews ontology research mainly published in the Scopus database from 2007 to 2017 with the combination of scientometric analysis and critical review. Scientometric analysis (e.g. co-author, co-word, co-citation, and clusters) objectively visualized the research status quo while a critical review was used to identify the research themes and challenges of ontology research in the construction industry. The results identified a large network of co-authors in this field to understand collaboration relationships. Over half the papers (53%) were published by the following three countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The top co-occurring keywords were "project management" at which ontology facilitates knowledge management and information retrieval. When the time factor was taken into consideration, keywords naturally evolved from "project management", and "knowledge management" to "building information modeling", and "compliance control" with the successful adoption of information techniques in the construction industry. Four research themes were identified with the combination of cluster analysis and critical review: "Domain ontology", "Industry foundation classes", "Automated compliance checking", and "Building information modeling". This review provides an in-depth understanding of existing ontology research and indicates the emerging trends in this research domain.

There are many good opportunities for doing a first and beneficial architecture evaluation-new development, modernization of a system, or selection of new technologies. We will share best practices regarding how to have a successful start and how this success can be sustained. Finally, we will look at more sophisticated architecture evaluation methods and how the discipline can be further improved with even more dedicated guidance or a higher degree of automation, for example by integrating repeated compliance checks into the build process.

There are two main problems with this approach. The first problem is that this verification method can be no more reliable than the humans that perform the manual steps. If rate of error for human work is a function of problem size, this holds not only for the construction of the original application, but also for the construction of the model. This means that the verification process tends to become unreliable for larger applications. The second problem is one of timing and relevance. Software applications built by teams of programmers can change rapidly, often daily. Manually constructing a faithful abstraction of any one version of the application, though, can take weeks or months. The results of a verification, then, can quickly become irrelevant to an ongoing design effort. In this paper we sketch a verification method that aims to avoid these problems. This method, based on automated model extraction, was first al,plied in the verification of the call processing software for a new Lucent Technologies' system called PathStar.(TM)	Bell Labs, Lucent Technol, Murray Hill, NJ 07974 USA	Holzmann, GJ (corresponding author), Bell Labs, Lucent Technol, 600 Mt Ave, Murray Hill, NJ 07974 USA.

Space systems have been a long time user of models (synchronous or asynchronous building blocks), from which code generators could derive analyzable code, while also providing additional benefits like simulation, model checking, etc. However the integration of multiple models to form one complete system was done manually, in an ad hoc and time consuming way. In this paper we show how a MDE process built around ASN.1, SDL, SCADE and AADL allows for more rigor by separating concerns to defining data models, functional blocks, interfaces and then behavior of a complete system; and then weave them to build the final systems. By automating the full process, we show the benefits from the system designer perspective: reduced implied complexity, quicker access to evaluation prototype of the end system.

While most of the recent work on automated termination proofs focuses on the construction of linear ranking functions, we develop an approach based on region graphs in which regions define subsets of variable values that have different effects on loop termination. In order to establish termination, we check whether (1) any region will be exited once it is entered, and (2) no region is entered an infinite number of times. We show the effectiveness of our proof method by experiments with Java code using a prototype implementation of our approach.

Currently, those applications are often written for Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in one of the supported modeling languages such as structured text, ladder diagrams and grafcets. The consequences of this approach are that (1) PLC experts are needed to develop the application, (2) it is difficult to verify the application's correctness and (3) when introducing other technologies such as embedded microcontrollers, even more experts are needed. This paper proposes an MDE development process that addresses these problems. The use of a domain-specific language eliminates the need for PLC experts, and developers can concentrate on the development of the building automation application. Models of the system or a transformation of those models to Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS), Statechart, or Causal Block Diagram (CBD) formalisms can be used to verify, simulate and optimize the application based on user needs. In a last step, the code for the target platforms can be generated directly from the verified and optimized models.

The pillars of FSHELL are the declarative specification language FQL (FSHELL Query Language), an efficient back end for computing test data, and a mathematical framework to reason about coverage criteria. To solve the reachability problem posed in SV-COMP we specify coverage of ERROR labels. As back end, FSHELL uses bounded model checking, building upon components of CBMC and leveraging the power of SAT solvers for efficient enumeration of a full test suite.

Can Automated Test Case Generation Cope With Extract Method Validation?

It is usually tricky to create an effective test suite for this task, since refactoring is not often applied in isolated steps. Rather refactoring edits may be combined with other edits in the code. In this sense, test case generation can contributed to this task by systematically analyzing the code and providing a wide range of test cases that address different constructions in the code. However, a number of studies in the literature have found that current tools can be ineffective regarding fault detection. In this paper, we present an empirical study that applies the Randoop and Evosuite tools for generating regression test suites, focusing on detecting Extract Method faults. Based on the study results, we identify factors that may influence on the performance of the tools for effectively testing the edits. To validate our findings, we present a set of regression models that associate the presence of these factors with the capability of the test suite detect faults related to the refactoring edit.

As we look to new technologies to solve existing problems, we can consider Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a tool to make construction safer and efficient. Through this paper, we explore the ways in which AI can assist in the goal of making construction sites safe. This study proposes the development of an AI platform, which improves construction safety through hazard identification at the pre-construction stage, and suggests the applicable OSHA codes for the identified hazards, thus allowing safety standards to be implemented for compliance. Emphasis is laid on the mitigation of fall hazards, which is the leading cause of accidents in construction. Currently, project safety and risk assessment in the construction industry is carried out by professionals, who heavily rely on their own experiences and knowledge on decision making. There is a lack of a systematic approach and the ways to check the reliability of these decisions. Through the machine learning aspect of AI, we can automate the process and create an environment where potential hazards are identified before they occur with a link to the OSHA standards for recommended mitigation strategies.

Graphical modeling languages and code generation technologies are enabling agile model development workflows, so that simulation modelers can update their models more easily. However, the process from changing the model to releasing a new simulation version is overlooked. Simulation deployment can be defined as a collection of activities, including model checking, Model-in-the-Loop testing, code generation, build, Software-in-the-Loop testing, deployment, when applicable Processor-in-the-Loop and Hardware-in-the-Loop testing and release. When it is conducted manually and ad hoc, it is repetitive, labor intensive, time-consuming and error prone. The automation of deployment pipeline, on the other hand, requires extensive scripting, unfortunately, in way in which simulation modelers are usually not accustomed. Causal Block Diagrams propose a graphical modeling language that is extensively used in simulation of technical systems. MATLAB/Simulink supports them as the basic modeling language. Exploiting the competence of MATLAB/Simulink users on Causal Block Diagrams, this paper presents a model-based approach for automating the simulation deployment activities. Thus, rather than scripting, the deployment automation functions are made available and accessible to the simulation modelers within the graphical modeling environment that they are using.

New functionalities, such as complex digital cockpit solutions, driver assistance algorithms and more, are all software based. The shortening of the development time while maintaining a high quality of software releases is an uneasy task. Many solutions in this regard exist in the industry. However, the cost prevents the wider developer community from participating on fair terms. In this paper, we argue that many open source technologies and frameworks can be utilized in addition to field-proven automotive development software. This way the total cost of the development, and time needed for testing and error checking can be reduced. Specifically, we extend the basic development process by utilizing open source build automation tools and servers to decrease the build and unit test time, and incorporate code-based analysis tools for static and dynamic analysis. These tools increase the software quality, and can be combined with commercial application lifecycle management tools, which are already used in the automotive industry.

C	Han, CS; Kunz, JC; Law, KH		Wang, KCP		Han, CS; Kunz, JC; Law, KH			A hybrid prescriptive-/performance-based approach to automated building code checking	COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Proceedings Paper	International Computing Congress Held in Conjunction with ASCE Annual Convention and Exposition on Information Technologies in Civil Engineering - Leading the World	OCT 18-21, 1998	BOSTON, MA	Amer Soc Civil Engineers, Tech Council Comp & Informat Technol, Comm Coordinat Outside ASCE				In design standards and building codes such as the Uniform Building Code (UBC) (ICBO94) or the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG) (ADAAG97), introductory provisions state the design intent or performance issues of a section, and subsequent prescriptive statements (provisions) outlining the methods to satisfy the design intent. Currently, prescriptive provisions are necessary to explicitly define a standard method to measure the design intent of a section of a design standard. As the provision statement becomes more prescriptive, the design intent is often lost or not fully captured. Consequently, ambiguity and inconsistency arise, thus making the design standard difficult to parse not only by computers, but for humans as well. This paper examines a design-intent approach to design standards processing to alleviate some of the difficulties and complexities of the code due to its prescriptive nature. By focusing on the design intent, it is possible to negate the problems of indeterminacy and conflicting provisions in a building code. There are two major aspects to our design intent approach to design standards processing. First, capture the design intent per each section of the code. Second, formulate and model an adequate performance test of the design intent. The approach is to model the building code's prescriptive statements where there is no indeterminacy and conflict, whereas when such problems surface, a performance-based approach is adapted. This work focuses on disabled access building code issues.

Each functionality needs to be tested in order to verify datasheet compliance. Testing time and effectiveness need to the improved, due to the close 40% testing costs out of the total product cost. This is achieved by using highly automated mixed signal test platforms and multiple chip test approach. Present work introduces the prerequisites of a low cost automated mixed signal test platform. It is developed in order to provide test functionality from independent schematic and concept to full product validation. The presented platform is built in order to fill the validation necessities of design and test engineers, by providing adaptability to multiple circuit topologies, easiness in adding test modules and facilitating the connectivity process. The platform is comprised of multiple modules that function alongside with dedicated laboratory equipment.

J	Guo, BHW; Goh, YM				Guo, Brian H. W.; Goh, Yang Miang			Ontology for design of active fall protection systems	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Ontology; Knowledge engineering; Construction safety; Fall from heights; Active fall protection systems	CONSTRUCTION SAFETY; KNOWLEDGE; PRINCIPLES; FRAMEWORK; REPRESENTATION; OPTIMIZATION; INDUSTRY; BIM	This paper aims to develop an ontology (AFPS-Onto) which formalizes the knowledge of active fall protection system (AFPS) design, with attempt to facilitate knowledge sharing and reuse. METHONTOLOGY was adopted as a method to build the AFPS-Onto. The AFPS-Onto consists of nine core concepts: hazard, actor, task, ifc building element, construction method, constraint, safety resource, hazard control measure, and residual risk. The concepts, relations, attributes, and axioms were coded using Prot g. The ontology was evaluated through automated consistency checking, criteria-based and task-based evaluation. The AFPS-Onto fills the knowledge gap by providing a formal and shared vocabulary for the domain of AFPS design. This can promote knowledge reuse and sharing among professional engineers. In addition, the ontology can be used to develop knowledge-based systems to help design effective AFPS. Future effort can be made to develop ontologies of other control measures against fall from heights and combine them into a fall from heights ontology (FFH-Onto). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

J	Zhao, XB				Zhao, Xianbo			A scientometric review of global BIM research: Analysis and visualization	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Review						Building information modeling; Co-citation; Research trend; Scientometrics; Visualization	INFORMATION MODELING BIM; CONSTRUCTION; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; SCIENCE; DESIGN; FUTURE; TOOLS	In the recent years, building information modeling (BIM) has transformed the architecture, engineering, and construction industry, and attracted attentions from both researchers and practitioners. However, few studies have attempted to map the global research on BIM. This study conducts a scientometric review of global BIM research in 2005-2016, through co-author analysis, co-word analysis and co-citation analysis. A total of 614 bibliographic records from the Web of Science core collection database were analyzed. The results indicated that Charles M. Eastman received the most co-citations and that the most significant development in BIM research occurred primarily in the USA, South Korea and China. Additionally, BIM research has primarily focused on the subject categories of engineering, civil engineering and construction & building technology, and the keywords "visualization" and "industry foundation classes (IFC)" received citation bursts in the recent years. Furthermore, 10 co-citation clusters were identified, and the hot topics of BIM research were: mobile and cloud computing, laser scan, augmented reality, ontology, safety rule and code checking, semantic web technology, and automated generation. This study provides researchers and practitioners with an in-depth understanding of the status quo and trend of the BIM research in the world.

J	Dawood, H; Siddle, J; Dawood, N				Dawood, Huda; Siddle, Jonathan; Dawood, Nashwan			INTEGRATING IFC AND NLP FOR AUTOMATING CHANGE REQUEST VALIDATIONS	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						3D models; IFC; NLP; AI; Web Services for construction	CODE COMPLIANCE CHECKING; BIM; MANAGEMENT; MODEL	The management and the identification of design changes constitute an essential part of the of a design flow within the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, requiring the formalisation of a multi-disciplinary collaborative information modelling environment. Construction projects generate substantial amount of change information, which needs to be updated continuously throughout the process, from initial feasibility study to the decommissioning of facilities. Complications arise from the information storage in multiple incompatible file formats that can lead to the loss or omission of details. In addition to any unexpected changes, the mismanagement of information is another factor leading to delays and costly errors. In order to mitigate such issues, this paper proposes to integrate the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data model and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to validate and visually identify the result of change requests. The system is developed using C# by 1) integrating angular framework with ASP.NET (Active Server Pages) to create a dynamic single web page and 2). Using X-BIM toolkit that supports IFC format to read, create and visualise the BuildingSmart Data Models (aka IFC Models). This approach enables a web-based platform capable of generating reports and visual previews, highlighting the differences between IFC files throughout the design processes. A web-based system prototype allows users to compare subsequent versions of IFC design models in terms of additions, modifications and deletions. The prototype uses NLP to intelligently identify the changes that have been made as it compares newer and older versions of the same model, making this information available to designers and 3D modellers. Prospective work will focus on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to automate the implementation of changes within the construction models.

J	Gholizadeh, P; Esmaeili, B; Goodrum, P				Gholizadeh, Pouya; Esmaeili, Behzad; Goodrum, Paul			Diffusion of Building Information Modeling Functions in the Construction Industry	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							CODE COMPLIANCE CHECKING; INNOVATION DIFFUSION; BIM ADOPTION; TECHNOLOGY; DESIGN; REQUIREMENTS; VISUALIZATION; SELECTION; SCHEDULE; ISO-9000	While advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs) have enabled architects, engineers, and contractors to reduce project time and cost and to improve quality, the diffusion of ICTs has typically been very slow in the construction industry. However, building information modeling (BIM) has overcome this diffusion challenge and has revolutionized such common practices as shifting the design process from two-dimensional (2D) drafting toward three-dimensional (3D) design, automated quantity takeoffs, and clash detection; such success marks the relevance of this technology for studying how technological innovations spread throughout the construction industry. Although some studies have explored BIM adoption, investigations using diffusion models to study the diffusion patterns of different BIM functions (e.g., 3D visualization, clash detection, energy modeling) are missing from the current literature. To fill this gap, this study uses reliable innovation diffusion models to describe the diffusion patterns of various BIM functions in the U.S. construction industry. Specifically, this study developed and sent a comprehensive questionnaire to 3,017 owner representatives, architects, and project managers; 118 individuals responded to the survey, of whom 81 are BIM users. The three most widely adopted BIM functions were 3D visualization, clash detection, and constructability analysis; the least frequently implemented functions were code validation; material tracking, delivery, and management; facility management; and energy analysis. Using these responses, this study analyzed the diffusion patterns of the BIM functions using four innovation diffusion models: internal (logistic), external, Bass, and Gompertz. Using such measures as Akaike's information criterion (AIC) and variants of it, this study identified the Bass model as having the highest explanatory power for diffusion and determined that internal factors (e.g., imitation and bandwagon pressure) have the most influence on adoption rates of BIM functions. Furthermore, the diffusion models showed that the shop-drawing process and facility management functions had the lowest saturation rate in 2014 (below 50%) but have a greater potential for being adopted in coming years. The findings of this study advance knowledge for both researchers and practitioners regarding the adoption process of different BIM functions and provide a theoretical basis for understanding the diffusion patterns of ICT innovations in the construction industry.

This requires a flexible, iterative development process in which different parts of the system under construction are built and updated concurrently. However, concurrent engineering becomes quite challenging in domains where different engineering artifacts from different disciplines come into play, such as safety-critical cyber-physical systems, where the involved engineering artifacts are quite heterogeneous in nature. In such systems, it is of utmost importance that different artifacts remain consistent in order to guarantee a correctly functioning end product. In this article, we discuss our experiences (with a leading company working in the areas of production automation and product processing) in maintaining the consistency between electrical models and the corresponding software controller, when both are subject to continuous changes. The article discusses how we let engineers describe the relationships between electrical models and the corresponding software controller code in the form of links and consistency rules. Additionally, we demonstrate that how our approach, through a process of continuous consistency checking, notifies engineers about the erroneous impact of their changes in various engineering artifacts.

There are two problems with this approach. The first problem is that this verification method can be no more reliable than the humans that perform the manual steps. If the average rate of error for human work is a function of the problem size, this holds not only for the construction of the original application, but also for the construction of the model. The standard verification trajectory therefore tends to become less reliable for larger applications. The second problem is one of timing and relevance. Software applications built by teams of programmers can change rapidly, often daily. Manually constructing an accurate abstraction of any one version of the application, though, can take weeks, which may jeopardize the validity of the results. In this paper a different verification method that avoids these problems is discussed. This method, which may be the precursor of a new class of testing techniques, was originally developed to allow for a thorough testing of parts of the software of a new commercial telephone switch. Here it is argued, though, that the method also has broad applicability to distributed software systems design in general.

Ecologists increasingly wish to use phylogenies, but are hampered by the technical challenge of phylogeny estimation. 2. We present phyloGenerator, an open-source, stand-alone Python program, that makes use of pre-existing sequence data and taxonomic information to largely automate the estimation of phylogenies. 3. phyloGenerator allows nonspecialists to quickly and easily produce robust, repeatable, and defensible phylogenies without requiring an extensive knowledge of phylogenetics. Experienced phylogeneticists may also find it useful as a tool to conduct exploratory analyses. 4. phyloGenerator performs a number of sanity checks' on users' output, but users should still check their outputs carefully; we give some advice on how to do so. 5. By linking a number of tools in a common framework, phyloGenerator is a step towards an open, reproducible phylogenetic workflow. 6. Bundled downloads for Windows and Mac OSX, along with the source code and an install script for Linux, can be found at http://willpearse.github.io/phyloGenerator (note the capital G').

Recent studies have investigated how developers perceive its ability to foster code quality, developers' code ownership, and team building. MCR is often being used with automated quality checks through static analysis tools, testing or, ultimately, through automated builds on a Continuous Integration (CI) infrastructure. With the aim of understanding how developers use the outcome of CI builds during code review and, more specifically, during the discussion of pull requests, this paper empirically investigates the interplay between pull request discussion and the use of CI by means of 64,865 pull request discussions belonging to 69 open source projects. After having analyzed to what extent a build outcome influences the pull request merger, we qualitatively analyze the content of 857 pull request discussions. Also, we complement such an analysis with a survey involving 13 developers. While pull requests with passed build have a higher chance of being merged than failed ones, and while survey participants confirmed this quantitative finding, other process-related factors play a more important role in the pull request merge decision. Also, the survey participants point out cases where a pull request can be merged in presence of a CI failure, e.g., when a new pull request is opened to cope with the failure, when the failure is due to minor static analysis warnings. The study also indicates that CI introduces extra complexity, as in many pull requests developers have to solve non-trivial CI configuration issues.

J	Lorenzen, F; Erdweg, S				Lorenzen, Florian; Erdweg, Sebastian			Modular and Automated Type-Soundness Verification for Language Extensions	ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	18th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming	SEP 25-27, 2013	Boston, MA			Languages; Verification; language extensibility; type soundness; automatic verification; metaprogramming; macros; SugarJ		Language extensions introduce high-level programming constructs that protect programmers from low-level details and repetitive tasks. For such an abstraction barrier to be sustainable, it is important that no errors are reported in terms of generated code. A typical strategy is to check the original user code prior to translation into a low-level encoding, applying the assumption that the translation does not introduce new errors. Unfortunately, such assumption is untenable in general, but in particular in the context of extensible programming languages, such as Racket or SugarJ, that allow regular programmers to define language extensions. In this paper, we present a formalism for building and automatically verifying the type-soundness of syntactic language extensions. To build a type-sound language extension with our formalism, a developer declares an extended syntax, type rules for the extended syntax, and translation rules into the (possibly further extended) base language. Our formalism then validates that the user-defined type rules are sufficient to guarantee that the code generated by the translation rules cannot contain any type errors. This effectively ensures that an initial type check prior to translation precludes type errors in generated code. We have implemented a core system in PLT Redex and we have developed a syntactically extensible variant of System F-omega that we extend with let notation, monadic do blocks, and algebraic data types.

Automation of the Solution of Kakuro Puzzles	RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS XXV			English	Proceedings Paper	28th SGAI International Conference on Innovative Techniques and Applications of Artificial Intelligence	DEC, 2008	Cambridge, ENGLAND	British Comp Soc Specialist Grp Artificial Intelligence			COMPLETION	Kakuro puzzles, also called cross SUM Puzzles, are grids containing Clues to the completion of numerical 'words'. Being structured in a similar way to crossword puzzles, Kakuro grids contain overlapping continuous runs that are exclusively either horizontal or vertical. The 'clues' take the form of specified run totals, and a puzzle is solved by placing a value in each cell Such that every run sums to its specified total, and no run contains duplicate values. While most puzzles have only a single solution, longer runs may be satisfied using many arrangements of values, leading to the puzzle having a deceptively large search space. The associated, popular Sudoku puzzle has been linked with important real-world applications including timetabling and conflict free wavelength routing, and more recently, coding theory due to its potential usefulness in the construction of erasure correction codes. It is possible that Kakuro puzzles will have similar applications, particularly in the construction of codes, where run totals may form a generalised type of parity check. A project has begun to investigate the properties of the class of Kakuro puzzles, and thereby establish its potential usefulness to real-world applications including coding theory. This paper reports some early findings from that project, specifically concerning puzzle complexity and the appropriateness of heuristic approaches for its automated Solution. It highlights the use of heuristics to guide search by a backtracking solver, in preference to local search optimisation, and reports on the effectiveness of two heuristics and a pruning technique for reducing solution time. The authors believe this to be the first published work in the use of heuristics, in combination with pruning, for the automated solution of Kakuro puzzles.	[Davies, R. P.; Roach, P.

The information extraction processes in those ACC systems are based on either human interpretation, manual annotation, or predefined automated information extraction rules. Despite the high performance they showed, rule-based information extraction approaches, by nature, lack sufficient scalability-the rules typically need some level of adaptation if the characteristics of the text change. Machine learning-based methods, instead of relying on hand-crafted rules, automatically capture the underlying patterns of the existing training text and have a great capability of generalizing to a variety of texts. A more scalable, machine learning-based approach is thus needed to achieve a more robust performance across different types of codes/documents for automatically generating semantically-enriched building-code sentences for the purpose of ACC. To address this need, this paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for generating semantically-enriched building-code sentences, which are annotated syntactically and semantically, for supporting IE. For improved robustness and scalability, the proposed approach uses transfer learning strategies to train deep neural network models on both general-domain and domain-specific data. The proposed approach consists of four steps: (1) data preparation and preprocessing; (2) development of a base deep neural network model for generating semantically-enriched building-code sentences; (3) model training using transfer learning strategies; and (4) model evaluation. The proposed approach was evaluated on a corpus of sentences from the 2009 International Building Code (IBC) and the Champaign 2015 IBC Amendments. The preliminary results show that the proposed approach achieved an optimal precision of 88%, recall of 86%, and F1-measure of 87%, indicating good performance.

J	Solihin, W; Eastman, C				Solihin, Wawan; Eastman, Charles			A KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION APPROACH IN BIM RULE REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS USING THE CONCEPTUAL GRAPH	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						BIM; Knowledge Representation; Conceptual Graph; Rule Checking	CHECKING; MODEL	Specifications of the exact requirements for BIM-based rules are often much more complex than it appears from their direct language interpretation. It is because the complete rule interpretation involves knowledge from human experts. Therefore, detailed interpretation process of rules for the purpose of automated rule checking implementation must be able to capture such knowledge and it must be retained throughout the implementation process. In order to ensure both completeness and precision, the knowledge capture needs to be formalized. We propose a formalized way to capture these requirements using a knowledge representation approach. Detailed analysis of the structure of the rules points to the conceptual graph (CG) as a suitable method for this purpose due to its expressiveness, which allows unambiguous description of the requirements. Such unambiguous description can be understood by all the participants in the implementation efforts. The conceptual graph is a representation that conforms to the first order logic that makes it suitable for the job. Using the conceptual graph, rules can be broken into their atomic rules and incorporates the unwritten domain checking knowledge that if done right will remove ambiguities that often plague building codes. It also provides a standardized way to capture and document the model data requirements and the high level checking logic as their functional requirements. With this, a layer that often separates the rule experts and the implementers can be eliminated, resulting in clarity and immediate usefulness for the implementation. The validity of this assertion is demonstrated using the comparison to the actual corresponding implementation of the rules.

Aside from the benefits which accrue as a side effect of building a formal model of a proposed system, these diagrammatic models can be useful as a means of communication between the development team and the users. However one of the greatest benefits of a formal model is that it can be subjected to rigorous examination to ensure that it satisfies properties required of the system. This paper describes the transformation used by the RDT toolset to generate Promela code (the input language of the SPIN model-checker) automatically from a model.

J	AHALT, SC; LEATHRUM, JF				AHALT, SC; LEATHRUM, JF			CODE-GENERATION METHODOLOGY USING TREE-PARSERS AND HIGH-LEVEL INTERMEDIATE REPRESENTATIONS	JOURNAL OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES			English	Article						CODE GENERATION; INTERMEDIATE REPRESENTATION; GRAMMARS; ANNOTATED GRAMMARS		The use of tree-parser-based code generators which parse high-level, tree-structured intermediate representations is described. This methodology is compared with previous parser-based code generators which have used relatively low-level, linearized intermediate representations. The use of a tree grammar allows for the automated pruning of the tree during the parse and for checking the grammar for consistency. This is accomplished by using a tree grammar which incorporates attributes which specify assertions that must be satisfied for parsing to continue. The result is a flexible, efficient code-generation scheme that can be used to build optimizing code generators. The grammar executes in time proportional to the number of nodes in the intermediate representation tree. The high-level intermediate representation is used to allow matching of the generated code to the source semantics. The proposed method is compared with others that have appeared in the literature, and the strengths and weaknesses of this approach are discussed.

Building Information Modeling (BIM) for LEED (R) IEQ category prerequisites and credits calculations	EWORK AND EBUSINESS IN ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION			English	Proceedings Paper	11th European Conference on Product and Process Modelling (ECPPM)	SEP 07-09, 2016	Limassol, CYPRUS			Interoperability; BIM; LEED; Mechanical Design; Sustainable Buildings		A good Indoor Environmental Quality is required for any building applying for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED (R)) certification. The room-by-room calculations required to demonstrate compliance with the Indoor Enviromental Quality (IEQ) prerequisites and credits, starting from the building geometry and use and the HVAC technical data, may be time consuming and error-prone. With Building Information Modeling (BIM) all the required data can be incorporated into the design model, thus speeding up the process, automate the design validation and minimize the errors. The research explored the use of BIM for the Mechanical design following the LEED IEQ P1 and IEQ C2 qualification, and the automation of calculus for the verification process with the use of Dynamo visual scripting tool for the data exchange between Autodesk Revit and electronic spreadsheets.

J	Kim, H; Lee, JK; Shin, J; Choi, J				Kim, Hayan; Lee, Jin-Kook; Shin, Jaeyoung; Choi, Jungsik			Visual language approach to representing KBimCode-based Korea building code sentences for automated rule checking	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL DESIGN AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						Visual language; BIM (Building Information Modeling); Korea Building Act; Building permit; Design assessment	DESIGN	The Building Information Modeling (BIM) and its applications enable an automatic building permit process based on 3D building models and their associated information. A crucial part of the building permit process is the interpretation and transformation of natural language-based building regulation into a computer-readable and executable format. As other countries and their projects have developed a certain type of rule-translation methods, KBimCode, part of the KBim application series, has been developed and supported by the Korean government to ignite an automatic, BIM-based building permit system on top of the current e-submission system, which is called Seumter. The rule translation process usually employs a computer hard-coded approach because of its ease of implementation, and there have been advances in making the computer understand the natural language-based building regulations using parametric input tables and script languages. This project includes a step for developing a logic rule-based approach for translating natural language into computer-executable code. However, the main contribution of this study is the introduction of an approach to represent such text-based regulations using visual language for novice programmers, architects, and rule reviewers. This paper describes a KBimCode visual language that is easy-to-write and intuitive because it uses visual symbols instead of textual coding.

Therefore, accurate attack graphs play a significant role in systems security. A manual construction of the attack graphs is tedious and error-prone, this paper proposes a model-checking-based automated attack graph generator and visualizer (A2G2V). The proposed A2G2V algorithm uses existing model-checking tools, an architecture description tool, and our own code to generate an attack graph that enumerates the set of all possible sequences in which atomic-level vulnerabilities can be exploited to compromise system security. The architecture description tool captures a formal representation of the networked system, its atomic vulnerabilities, their pre-and post-conditions, and security property of interest. A model-checker is employed to automatically identify an attack sequence in the form of a counterexample. Our own code integrated with the model-checker parses the counterexamples, encodes those for specification relaxation, and iterates until all attack sequences are revealed. Finally, a visualization tool has also been incorporated with A2G2V to generate a graphical representation of the generated attack graph. The results are illustrated through application to computer as well as control (SCADA) networks.

J	Koskimies, K; Systa, T; Tuomi, J; Mannisto, T				Koskimies, K; Systa, T; Tuomi, J; Mannisto, T			Automated support for modeling OO software	IEEE SOFTWARE			English	Article								A basic problem of software development is how to derive executable software components from requirements, and how this process could be systematized. The object-oriented approach provides a common paradigm throughout the software development process from analysis to implementation, enabling a smooth shift from one phase to another and use of a wide spectrum of tools. Current object-oriented CASE tools support various graphical notations for modeling an application from different perspectives, for consistency checking between models, for storing models in a repository, and for generating documents and code from models. However, the level of built-in automation is relatively low as far as the actual development process is concerned. In object-oriented analysis and design, or OOAD, dynamic modeling aims at specifying the dynamic behavior of objects. For an object whose role is to control other objects, specification of its dynamic behavior can often be given in the form of a finite-state machine. A simple state machine consists of states associated with actions, and transitions associated with events. The actions of a state are executed when this state becomes the object's current state.

On the Interplay between Non-Functional Requirements and Builds on Continuous Integration	2017 IEEE/ACM 14TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MINING SOFTWARE REPOSITORIES (MSR 2017)	IEEE International Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE/ACM 14th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR)	MAY 20-21, 2017	Buenos Aires, ARGENTINA	IEEE, Assoc Comp Machinery, IEEE Comp Soc		Software repository mining; Continuous integration; Topic models; Non-functional requirements		Continuous Integration (CI) implies that a whole developer team works together on the mainline of a software project. CI systems automate the builds of a software. Sometimes a developer checks in code, which breaks the build. A broken build might not be a problem by itself, but it has the potential to disrupt co-workers, hence it affects the performance of the team. In this study, we investigate the interplay between nonfunctional requirements (NFRs) and builds statuses from 1,283 software projects. We found significant differences among NFRs related-builds statuses. Thus, tools can be proposed to improve CI with focus on new ways to prevent failures into CI, specially for efficiency and usability related builds. Also, the time required to put a broken build back on track indicates a bimodal distribution along all NFRs, with higher peaks within a day and lower peaks in six weeks. Our results suggest that more planned schedule for maintainability for Ruby, and for functionality and reliability for Java would decrease delays related to broken builds.	[Paixao, Klerisson V.

QL builds on previous attempts to enable declarative program analysis through Datalog, but solves some of the traditional challenges: Its object-oriented nature enables the creation of extensive libraries, and the query optimizer minimizes the performance cost of the abstraction layers introduced in this way. QL enables agile security analysis, allowing security response teams to find all variants of a newly discovered vulnerability. Their work can then be leveraged to provide automated on-going checking, thus ensuring that the same mistake never makes it into the code base again. This paper demonstrates declarative variant analysis by example.

The system must be scalable, its operation must be completely deterministic and predictable, and above all it must produce common sense responses, i.e. the same responses that an experienced spacecraft engineer would produce in the same situation. It must be cheaper to build and maintain than the people it replaces. For practical purposes this rules out systems that utilize procedural languages such as Fortran or C, or any system in which the operational knowledge is embedded in code. It also militates against systems utilizing complex tool kits that require developers to undergo extensive training to become competent in their use. The system must be understood and trusted by the people who rely on it. It should provide large-scale automation of well, understood knowledge and must not require a paradigm shift on the part of the operators. Altairis MCS embodies an entirely new approach to the operation of complex systems through a unique automation technology based on Finite State Modeling (FSM). Conventional mission control systems provide extremely limited automation capabilities through limit checking and command scripts written in languages such as TSTOL of its variants, or can analyze at best a handful of telemetry parameters by means of a rule-based expert system application. Such applications have proven only marginally practical due to the great deal of time and expense required developing, testing and maintaining them. FSM, in contrast, captures human expertise in models as an adjunct to the normal systems engineering process all space missions must undergo.

The industry is facing huge challenges while developing Software (S/W)s at multiple sites and tested on multiple platforms. The best way to make CI faster and more efficient is to automate the build and testing process. Jenkins is a CI tool that helps in automating the complete process, reducing the work of a developer and check the development at each and every step of S/W evolution. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of Jenkins for software patch integration and release to client. We consider a real-life scenario, how the software development is carried out in corporate ventures and how Jenkins can save developers / integrators crucial work hours by automating the complete process. In this paper, Jenkins is implemented in a master / slave architecture where master node is the Jenkins server and slaves are the Jenkins clients. We discuss the usage of various plug-ins available that allow Jenkins to be used with any environment of software development.

It is well-known that the safety hazards of these stairs lead to loss of lives in the past. In this context, within the scope of the study, physical conditions of external escape stairs of existing buildings were examined in terms of providing an easy and fast escape from the buildings during a fire, and reducing the risk on someone's life safety. Based on the results, suggestions for solutions were made to eliminate or reduce the potential risks of external escape stairs. It is assumed that these suggestions will be beneficial for preventing possible health problems and loss of lives occurred at the external escape stairs and minimizing the potential damages faced by the users. In this study, automated building code compliance checking system is used. First of all, the potential sources of hazard in the external escape stairs are identified. It is thought that identifying the sources that could pose a hazard for people during the evacuation from the building in case of a fire can be beneficial to ensure taking necessary fire safety measures. Within the scope of the study, safety hazards related to different sources that could affect the life safety of users were also determined These sources were subsumed under two categories: access and usage. Besides, the physical conditions of external escape stairs were analyzed in the context of fire-related codes, standards and regulations valid in Turkey, United States of America, England and Russia.

NET languages) based on multiparty session types (MPST). There are two main contributions. Our library is the first practical development of MPST to support what we refer to as interaction refinements: a collection of features related to the refinement of protocols, such as message-type refinements (value constraints) and message-value dependent control flow. A well-typed endpoint program using our library is guaranteed to perform only compliant session I/O actions w.r.t. to the refined protocol, up to premature termination. Second, our library is developed as a session type provider, that performs on-demand compile-time protocol validation and generation of protocol-specific. NET types for users writing the distributed endpoint programs. It is implemented by extending and integrating Scribble (a toolchain for MPST) with an SMT solver into the type providers framework. The safety guarantees are achieved by a combination of static type checking of the generated types for messages and I/O operations, correctness by construction from code generation, and automated inlining of assertions.

Tutorial examples of the semantic approach to foundational proof-carrying code	FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th International Conference on Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications (TLCA 2005)	APR 21-23, 2005	Nara, JAPAN					Proof-carrying code provides a mechanism for insuring that a host, or code consumer, can safely run code delivered by a code producer. The host specifies a safety policy as a set of axioms and inference rules. In addition to a compiled program, the code producer delivers a formal proof of safety expressed in terms of those rules that can be easily checked. Foundational proof-carrying code (FPCC) provides increased security and greater flexibility in the construction of proofs of safety. Proofs of safety are constructed from the smallest possible set of axioms and inference rules. For example, typing rules are not included. In our semantic approach to FPCC, we encode a semantics of types from first principles and the typing rules are proved as lemmas. In addition, we start from a semantic definition of machine instructions and safety is defined directly from this semantics. Since FPCC starts from basic axioms and low-level definitions, it is necessary to build up a library of lemmas and definitions so that reasoning about particular programs can be carried out at a higher level, and ideally, also be automated. We describe a high-level organization that involves Hoare-style reasoning about machine code programs. This organization is presented using two running examples. The examples, as well as illustrating the above mentioned approach to organizing proofs, is designed to provide a tutorial introduction to a variety of facets of our FPCC approach. For example, it illustrates how to prove safety of programs that traverse input data structures as well as allocate new ones.

For every custom-built web application, the developer has to write their own validation code for every form used in application. This is a time consuming work for the developers which kills a lot of the development time of the application. This technique will help the developers to validate their forms without writing validation code which will minimize the development time for web applications and as well as increase developer's output. To validate a HTML form's field server-side validation is important because client-side validation is done by JavaScript. JavaScript validation will be meaningless if the users disable the JavaScript function of their browser. That's why server-side validation must be done by the developer in each web application. Its application procedure in web based applications is also discussed.

While PCC allows us to certify low-level binary code against relatively simple (e.g., memory-safety) policies, CMC enables the certification of a richer class of temporal logic policies, but is typically restricted to high-level (e.g., source) descriptions. In this paper, we present an automated approach to generate certified software component binaries from UML Statechart specifications. The proof certificates are constructed using information that is generated via CMC at the specification level and transformed, along with the component, to the binary level. Our technique combines the strengths of PCC and CMC, and demonstrates that formal certification technology is compatible with, and can indeed exploit, model-driven approaches to software development.

Organization and management of ATLAS nightly builds	17TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING IN HIGH ENERGY AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS (CHEP09)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	17th International Conference on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics (CHEP)	MAR 21-27, 2009	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC					The automated multi-platform software nightly build system is a major component in the ATLAS collaborative software organization, validation and code approval schemes. Code developers from ATLAS participating Institutes spread all around the world use about 30 branches of nightly releases for testing new packages, verification of patches to existing software, and migration to new platforms and compilers. The nightly releases lead up to, and are the basis of, stable software releases used for data processing worldwide. The ATLAS nightly builds are managed by the fully automated NICOS framework on the computing farm with 44 powerful multiprocessor nodes. The ATN test tool is embedded within the nightly system and provides results shortly after full compilations complete. Other test frameworks are synchronized with NICOS jobs and run larger scale validation jobs using the nightly releases. NICOS web pages dynamically provide information about the progress and results of the builds. For faster feedback, e-mail notifications about nightly releases problems are automatically distributed to the developers responsible.

CBM systems help maintainers to detect and manage the condition of aviation system components and take maintenance actions when there is evidence of need. In this paper we describe the application of a software prototype, which is an automation of the CBM practices. We briefly explain the novel framework on which it is built. We illustrate the building of the configuration information, required to generate the maintenance reports that are deemed essential for continuous improvement under CBM, using a markup language called XML. We explain the procedure in generating the reports using the developed prototype. We demonstrate that the developed prototype has the functional capabilities essential to implement CBM on any aircraft and is valuable in cutting down the software maintenance costs as it can perform new operations without having to modify the existing source codes.

J	Nguyen, VH; Dashevskyi, S; Massacci, F				Nguyen, Viet Hung; Dashevskyi, Stanislav; Massacci, Fabio			An automatic method for assessing the versions affected by a vulnerability	EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Software security; Empirical validation; Vulnerability analysis; National vulnerability database (NVD); Browsers		Vulnerability data sources are used by academics to build models, and by industry and government to assess compliance. Errors in such data sources therefore not only are threats to validity in scientific studies, but also might cause organizations, which rely on retro versions of software, to lose compliance. In this work, we propose an automated method to determine the code evidence for the presence of vulnerabilities in retro software versions. The method scans the code base of each retro version of software for the code evidence to determine whether a retro version is vulnerable or not. It identifies the lines of code that were changed to fix vulnerabilities. If an earlier version contains these deleted lines, it is highly likely that this version is vulnerable. To show the scalability of the method we performed a large scale experiments on Chrome and Firefox (spanning 7,236 vulnerable files and approximately 9,800 vulnerabilities) on the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). The elimination of spurious vulnerability claims (e.g. entries to a vulnerability database such as NVD) found by our method may change the conclusions of studies on the prevalence of foundational vulnerabilities.

J	Pedersen, L; Reza, H				Pedersen, Leif; Reza, Hassan			Using Pit to improve security in low-level programs	JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING			English	Article						Low level programming languages; Buffer overrun; Security; Compiler construction		Pit (Pedersen on http://pit.devpit.org, 2008; Pedersen and Reza in ISOLA '06: proceedings of the second international symposium on leveraging applications of formal methods, verification and validation (ISOLA 2006), pp. 111-118, 2006) is a new language for low-level programming, designed to be a self-hosting alternative to C. The novelty is that it supports automated memory management without excluding manual memory management, and without hindering key features associated with low-level programming, such as raw pointers, inline assembly code, and precise control over execution. This paper presents Pit as a language, and then examines how Pit's approach to memory allocation can be used to significantly increase the security of low-level programs. Automatic memory allocation is a useful tool of abstraction in many situations. Since Pit provides this tool without hindering low-level programming, it allows automated memory management to be used in programs where it previously could not be used, such as kernels. Specifically, this tool of abstraction can assist the programmer significantly in writing low-level code with fewer security problems caused by buffer overrun or integer overflow bugs by reducing the number of opportunities for such bugs in areas of code that do not need the precision of manual memory allocation. Existing solutions, such as Cyclone (Jim et al. in ATEC '02: proceedings of the general track: USENIX annual technical conference, pp. 275-288, 2002), add various ways of checking bounds, but have two major disadvantages: they require extra work from the programmer, and they detect but do not fix memory allocation bugs. Pit's approach simplifies what the programmer writes, making the code more understandable.

J	Di Angelo, M; Salzer, G				Di Angelo, Monika; Salzer, Gernot			Identification of token contracts on Ethereum: standard compliance and beyond	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DATA SCIENCE AND ANALYTICS			English	Article; Early Access						EVM bytecode; Heuristic; Interface; Smart contracts; Token standards; Transaction data	SALES	Next to cryptocurrencies, tokens are a widespread application area of blockchains. Tokens are digital assets implemented as small programs on a blockchain. Being programmable makes them versatile and an innovative means for various purposes. Tokens can be used as investment, as a local currency in a decentralized application, or as a tool for building an ecosystem or a community. A high-level categorization of tokens differentiates between payment, security, and utility tokens. In most jurisdictions, security tokens are regulated, and hence, the distinction is of relevance. In this work, we discuss the identification of tokens on Ethereum, the most widely used token platform. The programs on Ethereum are called smart contracts, which-for the sake of interoperability-may provide standardized interfaces. In our approach, we evaluate the publicly available transaction data by first reconstructing interfaces in the low-level code of the smart contracts. Then, we not only check the compliance of a smart contract with an established interface standard for tokens, but also aim at identifying tokens that are not fully compliant. Thus, we discuss various heuristics for token identification in combination with possible definitions of a token. More specifically, we propose indicators for tokens and evaluate them on a large set of token and non-token contracts. Finally, we present first steps toward an automated classification of tokens regarding their purpose.

Despite strong enforcement of construction best practices and regulations, accidents in construction industry are comparatively higher than other industries. Likewise, significant increase in injuries and fatalities are recently reported on geotechnical activities such as excavation pits and trenches. Academic researchers and industry professionals have currently devoted vital attention to acquire construction safety in preconstruction phase of the project. They have developed various algorithms to enhance safety in preconstruction phase such as automated generation of scaffolding and its potential risk analysis, checking BIM model for fall risks, and limited access zone allocation in wall masonry. However, safety in geotechnical works at preconstruction phase is yet unexplored. This paper proposed automatic safety rule compliance approach for excavation works leveraging algorithmic modeling tools and BIM technologies. The focused approach comprises of the following three modules: information extraction and logic design (IELD), information conversion and process integration (ICPI), and automodeling and safety plan generation (ASPG). Specifically, the scope of the paper is limited to major risks such as cave-ins, fall, safety egress, and prohibited zones risks. A set of rules-based algorithms was developed in commercially available software using visual programming language (VPL) that automatically generates geometric conditions in BIM and visualizes the potential risks and safety resources installation along with their quantity take-off and optimized locations. A case study has been presented to validate the proof of concept; automated modeling tool for excavation safety planning generated the required results successfully. It is anticipated that the proposed approach has potential to help the designers through automated modeling and assist decision makers in developing productive and practical safety plans compared to the conventional 2D plans for excavation works at the preconstruction phase. Moreover, it is realized that the same approach can be extended to other rule-dependent subjects in construction.

Freedom through constraints: User-oriented architectural design	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Natural Language Processing; Design constraints; Automated interpretation	NATURAL-LANGUAGE	In this article we report on validated research for the construction of design constraints by automated interpretation of natural language input. We show how our approach of dynamic reconfigurations of parsed syntax trees using a number of production rules is used to formalize and transform natural language constructs into computable constraints that are applied to concrete building information models. The calibration and validation of the proposed algorithms and production rules is based on two test data sets: The verbatim text of Dutch building code regulations for dormer extensions on existing roofs and constraints formulated ad hoc by design students based upon a series of example designs. We show how a prototypical implementation of our approach can be used to interpret 44% of the test data without human interference and how the remaining sentences can be interpreted with minimal additional effort or further development.

Automatic calculations in high energy physics and GRACE at one-loop	PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Review							ELECTROWEAK RADIATIVE-CORRECTIONS; W-PAIR PRODUCTION; FEYNMAN DIAGRAMS; BOSON PRODUCTION; DIMENSIONAL REGULARIZATION; E(+)E(-) ANNIHILATION; NUMERICAL EVALUATION; ALGEBRAIC REDUCTION; UNSTABLE PARTICLES; YANG-MILLS	We describe the main building blocks of a generic automated package for the calculation of Feynman diagrams. These blocks include the generation and creation of a model file. the graph generation, the symbolic calculation at an intermediate level of the Dirac and tensor algebra, implementation of the loop integrals, the generation of the matrix elements or helicity amplitudes, methods for the phase space integrations and eventually the event generation. The report focuses on the fully automated systems for the calculation of physical processes based on the experience in developing GRACE-loop which is a general purpose code applicable to one-loop corrections in the Standard Model. As such, a detailed description of the renornialisation procedure in the Standard Model is given emphasizing the central role played by the non-linear gauge fixing conditions for the construction of such automated codes. These new gauge-fixing conditions are used as a very efficient means to check the results of large scale automated computations in the Standard Model. Their need is better appreciated when it comes to devising efficient and powerful algorithms for the reduction of the tensorial structures of the loop integrals and the reduction of the N > 4 point-function to lower rank integrals. A new technique for these reduction algorithms is described. Explicit formulae for all two-point functions in a generalised non-linear gauge are given, together with the complete set of counterterms. We also show how infrared divergences are dealt with in the system. We give a comprehensive presentation of some systematic test-runs which have been performed at the one-loop level for a wide variety of two-to-two processes to show the validity of the gauge check. These cover fermion-fermion scattering, gauge boson scattering into fermions, gauge bosons and Higgs bosons scattering processes. Comparisons with existing results on some one-loop computation in the Standard Model show excellent agreement. These include e(+)e- -> tt. W+W-, ZH; yy -> tt, W+W-; e gamma -> eZ, vW and W+W- -> W+W-. We also briefly recount some recent development concerning the calculation of one-loop corrections to 3 body final states cross sections in e(+)e(-) with the help of an automated system.

Although previous developed vision-based approaches can be used for hazards recognition in terms of detecting dangerous objects or unsafe operations, such detection capacity is often limited due to lack of semantic representation of visual relationships between/among the components or crews in the workplace. Accordingly, the formal representation of textural criteria for checking improper relationships should also be improved. In this regard, an Automated Hazards Identification System (ARTS) is developed to evaluate the operation descriptions generated from site videos against the safety guidelines extracted from the textual documents with the assistance of the ontology of construction safety. In particular, visual relationships are modeled as a connector between site components/operators. Moreover, both visual descriptions of site operations and semantic representations of safety guidelines are coded in the three-tuple format and then automatically converted into Horn clauses for reasoning out the potential risks. A preliminary implementation of the system was tested on two separate onsite video clips. The results showed that two types of crucial hazards, i.e., failure to wear a helmet and walking beneath the cane, were successfully identified with three rules from Safety Handbook for Construction Site Workers. In addition, the high-performance results of Recall@50 and Recall@100 demonstrated that the proposed visual relationship detection method is promising in enriching the semantic representation of operation facts extracted from site videos, which may lead to better automation in the detection of construction hazards.

Automating Security Mediation Placement	PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS, PROCEEDINGS	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	19th European Symposium on Programming (ESOP 2010) held at the ETAPES 2010	MAR 20-28, 2010	Paphos, CYPRUS					We present a framework that automatically produces suggestions to resolve type errors in security-typed programs, enabling legacy code to be retrofit with comprehensive security policy mediation. Resolving such type errors requires selecting a placement of mediation statements that implement runtime security decisions, such as declassifiers and authorization checks. Manually placing mediation statements in legacy code can be difficult, as there may be several, interacting type errors. In this paper, we solve this problem by constructing a graph that has the property that a vertex cut is equivalent to the points at which mediation statements can be inserted to allow the program to satisfy the type system. We build a framework that produces suggestions that are minimum cuts of this graph, and the framework can be customized to find suggestions that satisfy programmer requirements. Our framework implementation for Java programs computes suggestions for 20,000 line programs in less than 100 seconds, reduces the number of locations a programmer must consider by 90%, and selects suggestions similar to those proposed by expert programmers 80% of the time.

Fuzzing is an automated black box testing technique used for finding security vulnerabilities in the software by providing random data as input. However, in the case of an interpreter, fuzzing is challenging because the inputs are piece of codes that should be syntactically/semantically valid to pass the interpreter's elementary checks. On the other hand, the fuzzed input should also be uncommon enough to trigger exceptional behavior in the interpreter, such as crashes, memory leaks and failing assertions. In our approach, we use evolutionary computing techniques, specifically genetic programming, to guide the fuzzer in generating uncommon input code fragments that may trigger exceptional behavior in the interpreter. We implement a prototype named IFuzzer to evaluate our technique on real-world examples. IFuzzer uses the language grammar to generate valid inputs. We applied IFuzzer first on an older version of the JavaScript interpreter of Mozilla (to allow for a fair comparison to existing work) and found 40 bugs, of which 12 were exploitable. On subsequently targeting the latest builds of the interpreter, IFuzzer found 17 bugs, of which four were security bugs.

MASINA is a methodology for specifying Multi-agent systems. The code generator takes MASINA models as input, and from them generates code for each one of the agents of the Multiagent System under construction. The code generation system SISGECOMA, as we call it, is composed of several agents: one that is interface with the user and captures all the information provided by him through MASINA models, another agent performs the verification and validation of the information, finally, another agent generates the Multiagents System	[Aguilar, Jose] Univ Los Andes, Escuela Sistemas, CEMISID, Dept Computac, Merida, Venezuela; [Bravo, Ruben] Univ Andes, Ctr Computac, Merida, Venezuela	Aguilar, J (corresponding author), Univ Los Andes, Escuela Sistemas, CEMISID, Dept Computac, Merida, Venezuela.	aguilar@ula.ve	Aguilar, Jose/H-3017-2015	Aguilar, Jose/0000-0003-4194-6882			Aguilar J, 2005, LECT NOTES ARTIF INT, V3681, P700; Aguilar J, 2005, LECT NOTES ARTIF INT, V3681, P191; Aguilar J, 2010, APPL ARTIF INTELL, V24, P785, DOI 10.1080/08839514.2010.499498; Aguilar J., 2008, REV AVANCES SISTEMAS, V5, P163; Aguilar J., 2008, INTELIGENCIA ARTIFIC, V12, P39; Aguilar J., 2009, INT J COMPUTER SYSTE, V24, P241; Aguilar J., 2006, INT J INFORM TECHNOL, V12, P121; Aguilar J, 2009, APPL ARTIF INTELL, V23, P406, DOI 10.1080/08839510902872256; Bravo C., 2004, CIENC ING, V25, P75; Bravo R., 2011, 132011 CEMISID U LOS; Bravo V., 2004, P 30 C LAT INF PER, P431; Mariela C, 2007, COMPUT IND, V58, P313, DOI 10.1016/j.compind.2006.07.008; Hidrobo F., 2005, WSEAS T COMPUTERS, V12, P1808; Meszaros T., 2009, ELECTR COMMUN, V21, P110; Rincon M., 2011, REV COMPUTACION SIST, V14, P405	15	0	0	0	0	IEEE	NEW YORK	345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA			978-1-4673-0793-2; 978-1-4673-0794-9				2012													10	Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic	Computer Science; Engineering	BG8YS	WOS:000392840200071					2021-09-17

Once restricted to static representations that represented the input-output behavior of models, research has developed the capability to build dynamic metamodels. This capability results from a new approach supported by a taxonomy of metamodeling problems, solution structures, and metamodeling methods. The development of the metamodel, however, still requires a thorough understanding of model abstraction, reduced order modeling, and system identification. In addition, even with the most robust procedures it is possible that the desired data generated by a simulation model will not meet the assumptions or numerical requirements of the procedure. Consequently, there is a requirement for a robust metamodeling: support system that will support the subject matter expert. Automation of the metamodeling process will assist the analyst who is not familiar with model abstraction techniques but needs to reuse a piece of code, integrate different models or verify a new version of a simulation. This paper describes the design of a, Metamodeling Support System that provides this automation.

Object-oriented modeling techniques further facilitate the development process. The Unified Modeling Language (UML), an object-oriented modeling approach, could be broad enough in scope to represent a variety of domains and gain widespread use. Currently, UML comprises several different notations with no formal semantics attached to the individual diagrams. Therefore, it is not possible to apply rigorous automated analysis or to execute a UML model in order to rest its behavior short of writing code and performing exhaustive testing. We introduce a general framework for formalizing a subset of UML diagrams in terms of different formal languages based on a homomorphic mapping between metamodels describing UML and the formal language. This framework enables the construction of a consistent set of rules for transforming UML models into specifications in the formal language. The resulting specifications derived from UML diagrams enable either execution through simulation or analysis through model checking, using existing tools. This paper describes the use of this framework for formalizing UML to model and analyze embedded systems. A prototype system for generating the formal specifications and results from an industrial case study are also described.

J	Chau, KW; Albermani, F				Chau, KW; Albermani, F			A coupled knowledge-based expert system for design of liquid-retaining structures	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						coupled knowledge-based expert system; design; liquid-retaining structures	FLOW	This paper describes a coupled knowledge-based system (KBS) for the design of liquid-retaining structures, which can handle both the symbolic knowledge processing based on engineering heuristics in the preliminary synthesis stage and the extensive numerical crunching involved in the detailed analysis stage. The prototype system is developed by employing blackboard architecture and a commercial shell VISUAL RULE STUDIO. Its present scope covers design of three types of liquid-retaining structures, namely, a rectangular shape with one compartment, a rectangular shape with two compartments and a circular shape. Through custom-built interactive graphical user interfaces, the user is directed throughout the design process, which includes preliminary design, load specification, model generation, finite element analysis, code compliance checking and member sizing optimization. It is also integrated with various relational databases that provide the system with sectional properties, moment and shear coefficients and final member details. This system can act as a consultant to assist novice designers in the design of liquid-retaining structures with increase in efficiency and optimization of design output and automated record keeping. The design of a typical example of the liquid-retaining structure is also illustrated. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

StocHy accepts a high-level description of stochastic models and constructs an equivalent shs model. The tool allows to (i) simulate the shs evolution over a given time horizon; and to automatically construct formal abstractions of the shs. Abstractions are then employed for (ii) formal verification or (iii) control (policy, strategy) synthesis. StocHy allows for modular modelling, and has separate simulation, verification and synthesis engines, which are implemented as independent libraries. This allows for libraries to be easily used and for extensions to be easily built. The tool is implemented in c++ and employs manipulations based on vector calculus, the use of sparse matrices, the symbolic construction of probabilistic kernels, and multi-threading. Experiments show StocHy's markedly improved performance when compared to existing abstraction-based approaches: in particular, StocHy beats state-of-the-art tools in terms of precision (abstraction error) and computational effort, and finally attains scalability to large-sized models (12 continuous dimensions). StocHy is available at www.gitlab.com/natchi92/StocHy. Data or code related to this paper is available at: [31].

Conceptually, a blockchain ( BC) is defined as a decentralized ledger that registers every transactional operation made in encrypted data format. The implementation of such concept bring about augmented security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in the work environment dynamics from the current centralized structure to a decentralized, cooperative chain of transactions by encouraging trust and transparency. This paper presents an overview of BC technology and its applications in the AEC industry and its potential integration with the building information ( BIM) process. Furthermore, the study explores how BC technologies can improve the BIM working environment by reinforcing network security, providing more reliable data storage and management of permissions, ensuring change tracing and data ownership. The paper discusses the fundamental principles of distributed ledgers, their current applications and potential future advances, and their classification based on inherent characteristics of consensus reaching and permission management. The study presents some examples the prospective application of BC technologies in enhancing the framework for automating the code compliance checking process such as smart contract technologies and Hyperledger Fabric, as well as discussing the pros, cons, possible directions, and future research directions.

Geometric validation of 3D city models based on standardized quality criteria	URBAN AND REGIONAL DATA MANAGEMENT			English	Proceedings Paper	Annual Symposium of the Urban-Data-Management-Society (UDMS)	MAY 29-31, 2013	London, ENGLAND	Urban Data Management Soc				High data quality of 3D city models is essential for modern applications. Although standards for quality of geospatial data have been published in the ISO 19100 series, there is no common understanding of quality for virtual city models. There are just too many different fields where 3D data can be exploited if compliance with data specifications is guaranteed. One example is the calculation of potential energy consumption for heating where closed solids are required to compute the building volumes. We describe a validation process for the geometry of city models. Modeling guidelines and recommendations were used to define exact specifications for a new city model. After creation of the model the compliance with these specifications is validated. Violations of the rules are detected and documented in a quality report. The validation process is automated and can be customized. Results of the validation process are analyzed with the target to improve the validation tool.

It is a manual process which uses Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR), where cheques have been scanned and sent to the clearing house for further processing. The limitations of existing CTS are - illegal duplication of cheque images, invisible ink usage, visibility issues in beneficiary name, and amount on the cheque. To handle the aforementioned issues of the existing CTS, blockchain has emerged as a new technology which is a distributed ledger that is timestamped and immutable. Being immutable, forgeries related to images of cheques during clearance cycles are not allowed. This provides trust and consensus among all participating entities in the network. Motivated by the above discussion, in this paper, we propose a framework named MudraChain for automated cheque clearance, where clearance operations are handled by the blockchain network, instead of existing CTS. It includes: (i) A multi-level authentication scheme to make the blockchain-based framework secure and tamper-proof among participating financial stakeholders, (ii) A quick-response (QR) code generation algorithm which performs digital signing of a cheque, and (iii) A novel two-factor authentication protocol to generate a time based one-time password (TOTP) for secure funds transfer. The obtained results are examined against state-of-the-art approaches to indicate the supremacy of the proposed framework. Thus, MudraChain allows a seamless flow of clearance operation via blockchain for the payer and the payee without any intermediaries. Finally, it addresses the requirements of building a secure application for cheque clearance in view of decentralized blockchain 4.0 applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

C	Chen, B; Curtmola, R			Internet Soc	Chen, Bo; Curtmola, Reza			Auditable Version Control Systems	21ST ANNUAL NETWORK AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM SECURITY SYMPOSIUM (NDSS 2014)			English	Proceedings Paper	21st Annual Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS)	FEB 23-26, 2014	San Diego, CA				PROOFS	Version control provides the ability to track and control changes made to the data over time. Software development often relies on a Version Control System (VCS) to automate the management of source code, documentation and configuration files. The VCS system stores all the changes to the data into a repository, such that any version of the data can be retrieved at any time in the future. Due to their potentially massive size, VCS repositories are often hosted at third parties which, unfortunately, are not necessarily trusted. Remote Data Checking (RDC) can be used to address concerns about the untrusted nature the VCS server by allowing a data owner to periodically and efficiently check that the server continues to store her data. To reduce the storage overhead, modern version control systems usually adopt "delta encoding", in which only the differences (between versions) are recorded. As a particular type of delta encoding, skip delta encoding can optimize the combined cost of storage and retrieval. In this work, we introduce Auditable Version Control Systems (AVCS), which are VCS systems designed to function under an adversarial setting. We present the definition of AVCS and then propose RDC-AVCS, an AVCS scheme for skip delta-based VCS systems, which relies on RDC mechanisms to ensure all the versions of a file are retrievable from the untrusted VCS server over time. In RDC-AVCS, the cost of checking the integrity of all the versions of a file is the same as checking the integrity of one file version and the client is only required to maintain the same amount of client storage like a regular (non-secure) VCS system. We make the important observation that the only meaningful operation for real-world VCS systems which use delta encoding is append and leverage this observation to build RDC-AVCS. Unlike previous solutions which rely on dynamic RDC and are interesting from a theoretical point of view, we take a pragmatic approach and provide a solution for real-world VCS systems. We build a prototype for RDC-AVCS on top of a popular open-source version control system, Apache Subversion (SVN), and implement the most common VCS operations. Our security analysis and experimental evaluation show that RDC-AVCS successfully achieves the desired security guarantees at the cost of a modest decrease in performance compared to a regular (nonsecure) SVN system.

J	Liu, KP; Tan, HBK; Chen, X				Liu, Kaiping; Tan, Hee Beng Kuan; Chen, Xu			Automated Insertion of Exception Handling for Key and Referential Constraints	JOURNAL OF DATABASE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Constraints Violation; Database Query Aware AST (DB-AST); Exception Handling; Key and Referential Constrains; Structured Query Language (SQL) Query Pattern; Transformation Rule	INTEGRITY; CHECKING	Key and referential constraints are two main integrity constraints in database applications. These constraints can be automatically enforced by the Database Management System with their exception-violation from these constraints-handled by programmers. This paper proposes an approach to relieve the burden of programmers from mechanical coding for handling exceptions of these constraints violation by using program transformation. We first propose an extended abstract syntax tree to include SQL query semantics. Based on it, each code pattern that requires exception handling together with the exception handling code to be inserted is represented as a transformation rule. We provide two alternatives to handle the exceptions: one is to handle the exceptions in conjunction with the built-in enforcement feature in Database Management System; the other is handling them without using the feature provided in Database Management System. Hence, two types of transformation rules are provided accordingly. A tool GEHPHP (Generation of Exception Handling for PHP Systems) has been developed to implement the proposed approach. Experiments have also been conducted to evaluate the applicable of the approach.

When it comes to the clearance of the bank cheques and monetary transactions, this should not only be reliable and robust but also save time which is one of the major factor for the countries having large population. In order to perform the task of cheque verification, we developed a tool which acquires the cheque leaflet key components, essential for the task of cheque clearance using image processing and deep learning methods. These components include the bank branch code, cheque number, legal as well as courtesy amount, account number, and signature patterns. our innovation aims at benefiting the banking system by re-innovating the other competent cheque-based monetary transaction system which requires automated system intervention. For this research, we used institute of development and research in banking technology (IDRBT) cheque dataset and deep learning based convolutional neural networks (CNN) which gave us an accuracy of 99.14% for handwritten numeric character recognition. It resulted in improved accuracy and precise assessment of the handwritten components of bank cheque. For machine printed script, we used MATLAB in-built OCR method and the accuracy achieved is satisfactory (97.7%) also for verification of Signature we have used Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for extraction of features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as classifier, the accuracy achieved for signature verification is 98.10%.

In this paper, we present trace refinement model analysis tools based on a generalized transition semantics of CSP, which we call HCSP, that merges the original transition system with ideas from Floyd-Hoare Logic and symbolic computation. This generalized semantics is shown to be sound and complete with respect to the original trace semantics. Traces in our system are symbolic representations of families of traces as given by the original semantics. This more compact representation allows us to expand the original CSP systems to effectively and efficiently model check some CSP programs that are difficult or impossible for other CSP systems to analyze. In particular, our system can handle certain classes of non-deterministic choices as a single transition, while the original semantics would treat each choice separately, possibly leading to large or unbounded case analyses. All the work described in this paper has been carried out in the theorem prover Isabelle [2]. This then provides us with a framework for automated and interactive analysis of CSP processes. It also gives us the ability to extract Ocaml code for an HCSP-based simulator directly from Isabelle. Based on the HCSP semantics and traditional trace refinement, we develop an idea of symbolic trace refinement and build a model checker based on it. The model checker was transcribed by hand into Maude [3] as automatic extraction of Maude code is not yet supported by the Isabelle system.

Its peal is to discover them while requiring minimal programmer's effort. In contrast to lint-like fools or verifiers, which try to maximise the number of errors reported at the expense of allowing "false errors", falsifier's goal is to guarantee no Salse errors. To further minimize programmer's effort, no specification or extra information about his program is required. That, however, does not preclude project specific information from being built in. The class of errors detectable without any specification is important not only because of the low, cost of detection, but also because it includes errors of portability, irreproducible behavior; etc, which ar-e very expensive to detect by testing. This paper describes the design and implementation of such a falsifier; and reports on the experience with its use for design automation software. The main contribution of this work lies in combining data-flow analysis with symbolic execution to fake advantage of their relative advantages.

To a great extent, the problem lies in the lack of a rigorous definition for TDD. An emerging approach has been to measure the conformance of TDD practices with the support of automated systems that embed an operational definition, which represent the specific TDD process assumed and the validation tests used to determine its presence and quantity. The empirical construction of TDD understanding and consensus building requires the ability of comparing different definitions, evaluating them with regard to practitioners' perception, and exploring code information for improvement of automatic assessment. Objective: This paper describes Besouro, a framework targeted at the development of systems for automatic TDD behavior assessment. The main rationale of Besouro's design is the ability to compare distinct operational definitions, evaluate them with regard to users' perception, and explore code information for further analysis and conformance assessment improvement. Method: We developed an architecture with clear separation of concerns, which enables to vary: (a) the atomic events and respective metrics to be collected from developing and testing environments; (b) the organization of atomic events in streams of actions or processes; and (c) the classification and assessment components for each set of operational definitions adopted. The architecture also includes a mechanism for on-line user assessment awareness and feedback, and integrates event-related information with the respective code in a code version system. Results: We illustrate the usefulness of Besouro's features for understanding the actions and processes underlying TDD through a prototype developed to support an experiment based on user feedback. We show how it was possible to compare variations of a same operational definition by exploring users' feedback, and use source code to improve the automatic classification of TDD practices. Conclusion: Understanding the actions and processes underlying successful TDD application is key for leveraging TDD benefits. In the absence of a rigorous definition for TDD, the proposed approach aims at building consensus from experimentation and empirical validation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Over the past few years, its formal correctness has been studied extensively by academia and industry, using general-purpose theorem provers. The objective of our work is to facilitate such endeavors by providing a dedicated environment for establishing the correctness of bytecode verification within a proof assistant. The environment, called Jakarta, exploits a methodology that casts the correctness of bytecode verification relatively to a defensive virtual machine that performs checks at run-time and to an offensive one that does not; it can be summarized as stating that the two machines coincide on programs that pass bytecode verification. Such a methodology has been used successfully to prove the correctness of the Java Card bytecode verifier and may potentially be applied to many similar problems. One definite advantage of the methodology is that it is amenable to automation. Indeed, Jakarta automates the construction of an offensive virtual machine and a bytecode verifier from a defensive machine, and the proofs of correctness of the bytecode verifier. We illustrate the principles of Jakarta on a simple low-level language extended with subroutines and discuss its usefulness to proving the correctness of the Java Card platform.

Parallelism enables fast builds by running independent tasks simultaneously, while incrementality saves time and computing resources by processing the build operations that were affected by a particular code change. Writing build definitions that lead to error-free incremental and parallel builds is a challenging task. This is mainly because developers are often unable to predict the effects of build operations on the file system and how different build operations interact with each other. Faulty build scripts may seriously degrade the reliability of automated builds, as they cause build failures, and non-deterministic and incorrect outputs. To reason about arbitrary build executions, we present Buildrs, a generally-applicable model that takes into account the specification (as declared in build scripts) and the actual behavior (low-level file system operation) of build operations. We then formally define different types of faults related to incremental and parallel builds in terms of the conditions under which a file system operation violates the specification of a build operation. Our testing approach, which relies on the proposed model, analyzes the execution of single full build, translates it into Buildrs, and uncovers faults by checking for corresponding violations. We evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability of our approach by examining 612 Make and Gradle projects. Notably, thanks to our treatment of build executions, our method is the first to handle JVM-oriented build systems. The results indicate that our approach is (1) able to uncover several important issues (247 issues found in 47 open-source projects have been confirmed arid fixed by the upstream developers), and (2) much faster than a state-of-the-art tool for Make builds (the median and average speedup is 39x and 74x respectively).

Their use in software engineering not only promotes high-level verification via theorem proving or model checking, but also inspires the "correct-by-construction" approach to software development viaformal refinement. Although this correct-by-construction method proves to work well for small software systems, it is still a utopia in the development of large and complex software systems. This paper moves one step forward in this direction by designing and implementing a sound linkage between the high level specification language Object-Z and the object-oriented specification language Spec#. Such a linkage would allow system requirements to be specified in a high-level formal language but validated and used in program language level. This linking process can be readily integrated with an automated program refinement procedure to achieve correctness-by-construction. In case no such procedures are applicable, the obtained contract-based specification can guide programmers to manually generate program code, which can then be verified against the obtained specification using any available program verifiers.

Modularity at the procedure-level is a natural instantiation of the modular verification paradigm, where correctness of global properties is relativized on the local properties of the methods rather than on their implementations. Here, it is based on the construction of maximal models for a program model that abstracts away from program data. This approach allows global properties to be verified in the presence of code evolution, multiple method implementations (as arising from software product lines), or even unknown method implementations (as in mobile code for open platforms). ProMoVer automates a typical verification scenario for a previously developed tool set for compositional verification of control flow safety properties, and provides appropriate pre- and post-processing. Both linear-time temporal logic and finite automata are supported as formalisms for expressing local and global safety properties, allowing the user to choose a suitable format for the property at hand. Modularity is exploited by a mechanism for proof reuse that detects and minimizes the verification tasks resulting from changes in the code and the specifications. The verification task is relatively light-weight due to support for abstraction from private methods and automatic extraction of candidate specifications from method implementations. We evaluate the tool on a number of applications from the domains of Java Card and web-based application.

Jinn: Synthesizing Dynamic Bug Detectors for Foreign Language Interfaces	PLDI '10: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2010 ACM SIGPLAN CONFERENCE ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION			English	Proceedings Paper	ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation	JUN 05-10, 2010	Toronto, CANADA	AMC SIGPLAN, ACM SIGSOFT		Multilingual Programs; Foreign Function Interfaces (FFI); Java Native Interface (JNI); Python/C; Dynamic Analysis; FFI Bugs; Specification; Specification Generation		Programming language specifications mandate static and dynamic analyses to preclude syntactic and semantic errors. Although individual languages are usually well-specified, composing languages is not, and this poor specification is a source of many errors in multilingual programs. For example, virtually all Java programs compose Java and C using the Java Native Interface (JNI). Since JNI is informally specified, developers have difficulty using it correctly, and current Java compilers and virtual machines (VMs) inconsistently check only a subset of JNI constraints. This paper's most significant contribution is to show how to synthesize dynamic analyses from state machines to detect foreign function interface (FFI) violations. We identify three classes of FFI constraints encoded by eleven state machines that capture thousands of JNI and Python/C FFI rules. We use a mapping function to specify which state machines, transitions, and program entities (threads, objects, references) to check at each FFI call and return. From this function, we synthesize a context-specific dynamic analysis to find FFI bugs. We build bug detection tools for JNI and Python/C using this approach. For JNI, we dynamically and transparently interpose the analysis on Java and C language transitions through the JVM tools interface. The resulting tool, called Jinn, is compiler and virtual machine independent. It detects and diagnoses a wide variety of FFI bugs that other tools miss. This approach greatly reduces the annotation burden by exploiting common FFI constraints: whereas the generated Jinn code is 22,000+ lines, we wrote only 1,400 lines of state machine and mapping code. Overall, this paper lays the foundation for a more principled approach to developing correct multilingual software and a more concise and automated approach to FFI specification.

J	Bak, N; Chang, BM; Choi, K				Bak, Nayeon; Chang, Byeong-Mo; Choi, Kwanghoon			Smart Block: A visual block language and its programming environment for IoT	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER LANGUAGES			English	Article						Visual block language; IoT; SmartThings; SmartApp ECA rule; IoTa; Blockly		A visual block programming language allows users to make their own programs by dragging and dropping graphic blocks rather than by writing the program. This enables users who are not proficient in programming to create programs easily. Although existing studies have applied this idea to programming Internet of things (IoT) applications, existing visual language tools have certain limitations in terms of expressiveness, extensibility, and error prevention. In this paper, we propose a visual block language called Smart Block for SmartThings home automation, together with a visual programming environment that supports the three properties. We designed the visual block language based on the Internet of things automation (IoTa) calculus, a core calculus for IoT automation that generalizes event-condition-action (ECA) rules. Each ECA rule specifies that when an event occurs, and if a condition is met, a certain action is performed. Smart Block supports writing IoT applications in the ECA style and is implemented with Google Blockly, a client-side JavaScript library for creating visual block languages. Smart Block can help users develop reliable SmartApps by checking for redundancy, inconsistency, and circularity in the ECA rules before generating the code. We demonstrate that Smart Block can build 54 out of 56 (96.4%) of the SmartApps provided by the official SmartThings IDE. Furthermore, a user study with 33 participants shows that our approach, based on the foundation of the IoTa calculus, is understandable for users.

Recent vulnerabilities such as Heartbleed, FREAK SSL/TLS, GHOST, and the Equifax data breach (due to a flaw in Apache Struts) were ultimately caused by third-party components. We argue that an automated way to audit the open-source ecosystem, catalog existing vulnerabilities, and discover new flaws is essential to using open-source safely. To this end, we describe the Security Graph Language (SGL), a domain-specific language for analyzing graph-structured datasets of open-source code and cataloguing vulnerabilities. SGL allows users to express complex queries on relations between libraries and vulnerabilities in the style of a program analysis language. SGL queries double as an executable representation for vulnerabilities, allowing vulnerabilities to be automatically checked against a database and deduplicated using a canonical representation. We outline a novel optimization for SGL queries based on regular path query containment, improving query performance by up to 3 orders of magnitude. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of SGL in practice to find zero-day vulnerabilities by identifying several flaws in the open-source version of Oracle GlassFish Server.

While results are encouraging, the importance of distributed systems warrants a large scale evaluation of the results and verification practices. This paper thoroughly analyzes three state-of-the-art, formally verified implementations of distributed systems: Iron-Fleet, Verdi, and Chapar. Through code review and testing, we found a total of 16 bugs, many of which produce serious consequences, including crashing servers, returning incorrect results to clients, and invalidating verification guarantees. These bugs were caused by violations of a wide-range of assumptions on which the verified components relied. Our results revealed that these assumptions referred to a small fraction of the trusted computing base, mostly at the interface of verified and unverified components. Based on our observations, we have built a testing toolkit called PK, which focuses on testing these parts and is able to automate the detection of 13 (out of 16) bugs.

J	de Albuquerque, JP; Krumm, H; de Geus, PL				de Albuquerque, Joao Porto; Krumm, Heiko; de Geus, Paulo Licio			Formal validation of automated policy refinement in the management of network security systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY			English	Article						Policy refinement; Model-based management; Formal validation; Security policies; Policy based management; Network security		Policy hierarchies and automated policy refinement are powerful approaches to simplify administration of security services in complex network environments. A crucial issue for the practical use of these approaches is to ensure the validity of the policy hierarchy, i.e. since the policy sets for the lower levels are automatically derived from the abstract policies (defined by the modeller), we must be sure that the derived policies uphold the high-level ones. This paper builds upon previous work on Model-based Management, particularly on the Diagram of Abstract Subsystems approach, and goes further to propose a formal validation approach for the policy hierarchies yielded by the automated policy refinement process. We establish general validation conditions for a multi-layered policy model, i.e. necessary and sufficient conditions that a policy hierarchy must satisfy so that the lower-level policy sets are valid refinements of the higher-level policies according to the criteria of consistency and completeness. Relying upon the validation conditions and upon axioms about the model representativeness, two theorems are proved to ensure compliance between the resulting system behaviour and the abstract policies that are modelled.

However, neither stand-alone verification approaches, like simulation-based or formal verification, nor state-of-the-art hybrid/semiformal verification approaches are able to verify large and complex embedded software with hardware dependencies. This work presents an optimized scalable hybrid verification approach for the verification of embedded software with hardware dependencies using a mixed bottom-up/top-down algorithm with optimized static parameter assignment (SPA). These algorithms and methodologies like SPA and counterexample guided simulation are used to combine simulation-based and formal verification in a new way. SPA offers a way to interact between dynamic and static verification approaches based on an automated ranking heuristic of possible function parameters according to the impact on the model size. Furthermore, SPA inserts initialization code for specific function parameters into the source code under test and supports model building and optimization algorithms to reduce the state space. We have successfully applied this optimized hybrid verification methodology to an embedded software application: Motorola's Powerstone Benchmark suite. The results show that our approach scales better than stand-alone software model checkers to reach deep state spaces.

Natural Proofs for Data Structure Manipulation in C using Separation Logic	ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	35th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI)	JUN 09-11, 2014	Edinburgh, SCOTLAND	Assoc Comp Machinery Special Interest Grp Programming Languages, NSF		program verifiers; data structures; natural proofs; separation logic	AUTOMATED VERIFICATION; CHECKING; BOOGIE	The natural proof technique for heap verification developed by Qiu et al. [32] provides a platform for powerful sound reasoning for specifications written in a dialect of separation logic called Dryad. Natural proofs are proof tactics that enable automated reasoning exploiting recursion, mimicking common patterns found in human proofs. However, these proofs are known to work only for a simple toy language [32]. In this work, we develop a framework called VCDRYAD that extends the VCC framework [9] to provide an automated deductive framework against separation logic specifications for C programs based on natural proofs. We develop several new techniques to build this framework, including (a) a novel tool architecture that allows encoding natural proofs at a higher level in order to use the existing VCC framework (including its intricate memory model, the underlying type-checker, and the SMT-based verification infrastructure), and (b) a synthesis of ghost-code annotations that captures natural proof tactics, in essence forcing VCC to find natural proofs using primarily decidable theories. We evaluate our tool extensively, on more than 150 programs, ranging from code manipulating standard data structures, well-known open source library routines (Glib, OpenBSD), Linux kernel routines, customized OS data structures, etc. We show that all these C programs can be fully automatically verified using natural proofs (given pre/post conditions and loop invariants) without any user-provided proof tactics. VCDRYAD is perhaps the first deductive verification framework for heap-manipulating programs in a real language that can prove such a wide variety of programs automatically.

The lack of language constructs in configuration files, such as types and grammars, has directed the focus of a configuration file verification towards building post-failure error diagnosis tools. In addition, the existing tools are generally language specific, requiring the user to define at least a grammar for the language models and explicit rules to check. In this paper, we propose a framework which analyzes datasets of correct configuration files and derives rules for building a language model from the given dataset. The resulting language model can be used to verify new configuration files and detect errors in them. Our proposed framework is highly modular, does not rely on the system source code, and can be applied to any new configuration file type with minimal user input. Our tool, named ConfigC, relies on an abstract representation of language rules to allow for this modularity. ConfigC supports learning of various rules, such as orderings, value relations, type errors, or user defined rules by using a probabilistic type inference strategy and defining a small interface for the rule type.

The key idea is to reflect the code implementing a user-defined function into the function's (output) refinement type. As a consequence, at uses of the function, the function definition is instantiated in the SMT logic in a precise fashion that permits decidable verification. Reflection allows the user to write equational proofs of programs just by writing other programs e.g. using pattern-matching and recursion to perform case-splitting and induction. Thus, via the propositions-as-types principle, we show that reflection permits the specification of arbitrary functional correctness properties. Finally, we introduce a proof-search algorithm called Proof by Logical Evaluation that uses techniques from model checking and abstract interpretation, to completely automate equational reasoning. We have implemented reflection in LIQUID HASKELL and used it to verify that the widely used instances of the Monoid, Applicative, Functor, and Monad typeclasses actually satisfy key algebraic laws required to make the clients safe, and have used reflection to build the first library that actually verifies assumptions about associativity and ordering that are crucial for safe deterministic parallelism.

Due to the unprecedented code chum rates enabled by the WWW, developers may not have time to determine whether their recent modifications have caused integration problems with the overall OSS; these problems can often be detected via GUI integration testing. However, the resource-intensive nature of GUI testing prevents the application of existing automated QA techniques used during conventional OSS evolution. In this paper we develop new process support for three nested techniques that leverage developer communities interconnected by the WWW to automate model-based testing of evolving GUI-based OSS. The "innermost" technique (crash testing) operates on each code check-in of the GUI software and performs a quick and fully automatic integration test. The second technique (smoke testing) operates on each day's GUI build and performs functional "reference testing" of the newly integrated version of the GUI The third (outermost) technique (comprehensive GUI testing) conducts detailed integration testing of a major GUI release. An empirical study involving four popular OSS shows that (1) the overall approach is useful to detect severe faults in GUI-based OSS and (2) the nesting paradigm helps to target feedback and makes effective use of the WWW by implicitly distributing QA.

The method is based on an extension to Petri nets. The modelling power of the proposed nets is shown by comparison with the functional specification language PAISLey. Extended Petri nets provide a framework for building an executable model of a specification (prototype), automated transformation of the model structure, simulation and validation of the model behaviour, and automated code generation for the validated structure. The method is illustrated using a laboratory process-control system as a working example.

Designing blockchain-based applications a case study for imported product traceability	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE			English	Article						Blockchain; Smart contract; Adaptability; Software architecture		Blockchain technology enables decentralization as new forms of distributed software architectures, where components can reach agreements on the shared system states without trusting on a central integration point. Since blockchain is an emerging technology which is still at an early stage of development, there is limited experience on applying blockchain to real-world software applications. We applied blockchain application design approaches proposed in software architecture community in a real-world project called originChain, which is a blockchain-based traceability system that restructures the current system by replacing the central database with blockchain. In this paper, we share our experience of building originChain. By using blockchain and designing towards security, originChain provides transparent tamper-proof traceability data with high availability and enables automated regulatory-compliance checking and adaptation in product traceability scenarios. We also demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the software architecture of originChain. Based on our experience and analysis, we found that the structural design of smart contracts has large impact on the quality of the system. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Mostaeen, G; Roy, B; Roy, CK; Schneider, K; Svajlenko, J				Mostaeen, Golam; Roy, Banani; Roy, Chanchal K.; Schneider, Kevin; Svajlenko, Jeffrey			A machine learning based framework for code clone validation	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article						Code clones; Validation; Machine learning; Clone management	SYSTEM	A code clone is a pair of code fragments, within or between software systems that are similar. Since code clones often negatively impact the maintainability of a software system, several code clone detection techniques and tools have been proposed and studied over the last decade. However, the clone detection tools are not always perfect and their clone detection reports often contain a number of false positives or irrelevant clones from specific project management or user perspective. To detect all possible similar source code patterns in general, the clone detection tools work on the syntax level while lacking user-specific preferences. This often means the clones must be manually inspected before analysis in order to remove those false positives from consideration. This manual clone validation effort is very time-consuming and often error-prone, in particular for large-scale clone detection. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach for automating the validation process. First, a training dataset is built by taking code clones from several clone detection tools for different subject systems and then manually validating those clones. Second, several features are extracted from those clones to train the machine learning model by the proposed approach. The trained algorithm is then used to automatically validate clones without human inspection. Thus the proposed approach can be used to remove the false positive clones from the detection results, automatically evaluate the precision of any clone detectors for any given set of datasets, evaluate existing clone benchmark datasets, or even be used to build new clone benchmarks and datasets with minimum effort. In an experiment with clones detected by several clone detectors in several different software systems, we found our approach has an accuracy of up to 87.4% when compared against the manual validation by multiple expert judges. The proposed method also shows better results in several comparative studies with the existing related approaches for clone classification. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Nawari, NO; Ravindran, S				Nawari, Nawari O.; Ravindran, Shriraam			Blockchain and the built environment: Potentials and limitations	JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING			English	Review						Blockchain; BIM; Distributed ledger; Hyperledger fabric; Smart contract; Code-checking	CYBERSECURITY	Blockchain is a relatively new concept that originated from the first cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin and was soon noted to have a much wider range of applications than just serving as the platform for digital cryptocurrency. A blockchain (BC) is essentially a decentralized ledger that records every transaction made in the network, known as a 'block', the body of which comprises encrypted data of the entire transaction history. The implementation of decentralized technology in any industry would require augmented security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in workflow dynamics from the current hierarchical structure to a decentralized, cooperative chain of command and affect a cultural and societal change by encouraging trust and transparency. This paper presents an evaluation survey of blockchain technology and its applications in the built environment and examines the potential integration with the BIM process. Moreover, the study explores how employing distributed ledger technology (DLT) could be advantageous in the BIM working environment by reinforcing network security, providing more reliable data storage and management of permissions, and ensuring change tracing and data ownership. The study discusses the basic fundamentals of distributed ledgers, their potential future applications and current advances, and their classification based on inherent characteristics of consensus reaching and permission management. Furthermore, the paper evaluates the potential application of BC technologies in enhancing the framework for automating the construction design review process such as smart contract technologies and Hyperledger Fabric, as well as discussing the pros, cons, and possible future research directions.

Building a push-button RESOLVE verifier: Progress and challenges	FORMAL ASPECTS OF COMPUTING			English	Article						Languages; Software engineering; Theorem proving; Tools; Verification	DECISION PROCEDURES; DESIGN; VERIFICATION	A central objective of the verifying compiler grand challenge is to develop a push-button verifier that generates proofs of correctness in a syntax-driven fashion similar to the way an ordinary compiler generates machine code. The software developer's role is then to provide suitable specifications and annotated code, but otherwise to have no direct involvement in the verification step. However, the general mathematical developments and results upon which software correctness is based may be established through a separate formal proof process in which proofs might be mechanically checked, but not necessarily automatically generated. While many ideas that could conceivably form the basis for software verification have been known "in principle" for decades, and several tools to support an aspect of verification have been devised, practical fully automated verification of full software behavior remains a grand challenge. This paper explains how RESOLVE takes a step towards addressing this challenge by integrating foundational and practical elements of software engineering, programming languages, and mathematical logic into a coherent framework. Current versions of the RESOLVE verifier generate verification conditions (VCs) for the correctness of component-based software in a modular fashion-one component at a time. The VCs are currently verified using automated capabilities of the Isabelle proof assistant, the SMT solver Z3, a minimalist rewrite prover, and some specialized decision procedures. Initial experiments with the tools and further analytic considerations show both the progress that has been made and the challenges that remain.

C	Murphy, C; Shen, K; Kaiser, G				Murphy, Christian; Shen, Kuang; Kaiser, Gail			Using JML Runtime Assertion Checking to Automate Metamorphic Testing in Applications without Test Oracles	SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE TESTING, VERIFICATION, AND VALIDATION, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation Workshops	APR 01-04, 2009	Denver, CO	IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE, Microsoft Res, IBM Res, ICST				It is challenging to test applications and,functions for which the correct output for arbitrary input cannot be known in advance, e.g. some computational science or machine learning applications. In the absence of a test oracle, one approach to testing these applications is to use metamorphic testing: existing test case input is modified to produce new test cases in such a manner that, when given the new input, the application should produce an output that can be easily be computed based on the original output. That is, if input x produces output f(x), then we create input x' such that we can predict f(x') based on f(x); if the application or function does not produce the expected output, then a defect must exist, and either f(x) or f(x') (or both) is wrong. By using metamorphic testing, we are able to provide built-in "pseudo-oracles "for these so-called "non-testable programs" that have no test oracles. In this paper we describe an approach in which a function's metamorphic properties are specified using an extension to the Java Modeling Language (JML), a behavioral interface specification language that is used to support the "design by contract" paradigm in Java applications. Our implementation, called Corduroy, pre-processes these specifications and generates test code that can be executed using JML runtime assertion checking, for ensuring that the specifications hold during program execution. In addition to presenting our approach and implementation, we also describe our findings from case studies in which we apply our technique to applications without test oracles.

Several other dependently-typed languages such as Aura, ATS, Cayenne, Epigram, F-star, F7, Fine, Guru, PCML5, and Ur also explore reliable ways to develop and verify programs. All these languages shine in their own regard, but their implementations do not themselves enjoy the degree of safety provided by machine-checked verification. We propose a general technique called self-certification that allows a typechecker for a suitably expressive language to be certified for correctness. We have implemented this technique for F-star, a dependently typed language on the. NET platform. Self-certification involves implementing a typechecker for F-star in F-star, while using all the conveniences F ? provides for the compiler-writer (e. g., partiality, effects, implicit conversions, proof automation, libraries). This typechecker is given a specification (in F-star) strong enough to ensure that it computes valid typing derivations. We obtain a typing derivation for the core typechecker by running it on itself, and we export it to Coq as a type-derivation certificate. By typechecking this derivation (in Coq) and applying the F-star metatheory (also mechanized in Coq), we conclude that our type checker is correct. Once certified in this manner, the F-star typechecker is emancipated from Coq. Self-certification leads to an efficient certification scheme-we no longer depend on verifying certificates in Coq-as well as a more broadly applicable one. For instance, the self-certified F-star checker is suitable for use in adversarial settings where Coq is not intended for use, such as run-time certification of mobile code.

Hierarchy Software Development Framework (h-dp-fwk) Project	17TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING IN HIGH ENERGY AND NUCLEAR PHYSICS (CHEP09)	Journal of Physics Conference Series		English	Proceedings Paper	17th International Conference on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics (CHEP)	MAR 21-27, 2009	Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC					Hierarchy Software Development Framework provides a lightweight tool for building portable modular applications for performing automated data analysis tasks in a batch mode. The history of design and development activities devoted to the project has begun in March 2005 and from the very beginning it was targeting the case of building experimental data processing applications for the CMD-3 experiment which is being commissioned at Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics (BINP, Novosibirsk, Russia). Its design addresses the generic case of modular data processing application operating within the well defined distributed computing environment. The main features of the framework are modularity, built-in message and data exchange mechanisms, XInclude and XML schema enabled XML configuration management tools, dedicated log management tools, internal debugging tools, both dynamic and static module chains support, internal DSO version and consistency checking, well defined API for developing specialized frameworks. It is supported on Scientific Linux 4 and 5 and planned to be ported to other platforms as well. The project is provided with the comprehensive set of technical documentation and users' guides. The licensing schema for the source code, binaries and documentation implies that the product is free for non-commercial use. Although the development phase is not over and many features are to be implemented yet the project is considered ready for public use and creating applications in various fields including development of events reconstruction software for small and moderate scale HEP experiments.

Accessibility refers to providing functionality to smart phone apps (and web) so that all human can access contents/service/products on the Internet regardless their age and disability. Accessibility support is essential for mobile users owing to the unique nature and capabilities of mobile devices, such as smaller screens, touch and gesture interface, and built-in screen readers specific to operating systems. The latest mobile device usage statistics showed that between the two different mobile channels, mobile apps and mobile webs, consumers spend most of their time in mobile apps. Accessibility of apps in a smartphone is more important than ever as more people use a smartphone apps to consume content/ service/ product on the Internet. Automated tools for mobile apps that evaluate compliance with accessibility standards are still scarce. This makes it difficult for developers who are unfamiliar with accessibility needs to ensure their apps are accessible by everyone. While the prototype does not include all the functions, it demonstrates that it is feasible to develop a full version of an automatic assessment tool for smartphone apps, which is an under-researched area. This paper designs an accessibility evaluation tool that checks mobile apps for conformance with accessibility standards, and develops a prototype of the evaluation tool. The proposed tool verifies the existence (or nonexistence) of alternative text for non-text content, which is an important accessibility factor for visually impaired users. It discovers missing alternative text by checking the contentDescription attribute of the ImageView element in Android XML files.

The virtual commissioning (VC) of automated plants in the production industry is a promising method to ensure both quality and adherence to delivery dates during this process. However, building simulation models is often paired with high efforts that stand against the benefits of VC. The paper shows how this effort can be minimized by an automatic generation of simulation models.

However, difficulties arise when repayment strategies are defined because software architects need to be aware of the consequences of these strategies over others decisions in the software architecture. This article proposes REBEL, a semi-automated model-driven approach that exploits natural language processing, machine learning and model checking techniques on heterogeneous project artifacts to build a model that allows to locate and visualize the impact produced by the consciously injected ATD and its repayment strategy on the other architectural decisions. The technique is illustrated with a data analytics project in Colombia where software architects are unaware of the consequences of the repayment strategies. This proposal seeks to support teams of architects to make explicit the current and future impact of the ATD injected as a result of decisions taken, focusing on the architectural level rather than code level.

J	Reder, A; Egyed, A				Reder, Alexander; Egyed, Alexander			Determining the Cause of a Design Model Inconsistency	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Design tools and techniques; programming environments/construction tools; validation	MANAGEMENT	When a software engineer finds an inconsistency in a model, then the first question is why? What caused it? Obviously, there must be an error. But where could it be? Or is the design rule erroneous and if yes then which part? The cause of an inconsistency identifies the part of the model or design rule where the error must be. We believe that the visualization of an inconsistency ought to visualize the cause. Understanding the cause is of vital importance before a repair can even be formulated. Indeed, any automation (e. g., code generation, refactoring) has to be considered with caution if it involves model elements that cause inconsistencies. This paper analyzes the basic structure of inconsistent design rules as well as their behavior during validation and presents an algorithm for computing its cause. The approach is fully automated, tool supported, and was evaluated on 14,111 inconsistencies across 29 design models. We found that our approach computes correct causes for inconsistencies, these causes are nearly always a subset of the model elements investigated by the design rules' validation (a naive cause computation approximation), and the computation is very fast (99.8 percent of the causes are computable in <100 ms).

Jinn: Synthesizing Dynamic Bug Detectors for Foreign Language Interfaces	ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation	JUN 05-10, 2010	Toronto, CANADA	AMC SIGPLAN, ACM SIGSOFT		Design; Languages; Reliability; Verification; Multilingual Programs; Foreign Function Interfaces (FFI); Java Native Interface (JNI); Python/C; Dynamic Analysis; FFI Bugs; Specification; Specification Generation		Programming language specifications mandate static and dynamic analyses to preclude syntactic and semantic errors. Although individual languages are usually well-specified, composing languages is not, and this poor specification is a source of many errors in multilingual programs. For example, virtually all Java programs compose Java and C using the Java Native Interface (JNI). Since JNI is informally specified, developers have difficulty using it correctly, and current Java compilers and virtual machines (VMs) inconsistently check only a subset of JNI constraints. This paper's most significant contribution is to show how to synthesize dynamic analyses from state machines to detect foreign function interface (FFI) violations. We identify three classes of FFI constraints encoded by eleven state machines that capture thousands of JNI and Python/C FFI rules. We use a mapping function to specify which state machines, transitions, and program entities (threads, objects, references) to check at each FFI call and return. From this function, we synthesize a context-specific dynamic analysis to find FFI bugs. We build bug detection tools for JNI and Python/C using this approach. For JNI, we dynamically and transparently interpose the analysis on Java and C language transitions through the JVM tools interface. The resulting tool, called Jinn, is compiler and virtual machine independent. It detects and diagnoses a wide variety of FFI bugs that other tools miss. This approach greatly reduces the annotation burden by exploiting common FFI constraints: whereas the generated Jinn code is 22,000+ lines, we wrote only 1,400 lines of state machine and mapping code. Overall, this paper lays the foundation for a more principled approach to developing correct multilingual software and a more concise and automated approach to FFI specification.

The Science of Deep Specification (Keynote)	COMPANION PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2016 ACM SIGPLAN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMS, PROGRAMMING, LANGUAGES AND APPLICATIONS: SOFTWARE FOR HUMANITY (SPLASH COMPANION'16)			English	Proceedings Paper	ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH Companion)	OCT 30-NOV 04, 2016	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	Assoc Comp Machinery, Assoc Comp Machinery SIGPLAN		Verified Systems Software; Property-Based Testing; Coq; CertiKOS; Verified Software Toolchain; CompCert; QuickChick; Vellvm; Kami		The Abstraction and modularity underlie all successful hardware and software systems: We build complex artifacts by decomposing them into parts that can be understood separately. Modular decomposition depends crucially on the artful choice of interfaces between pieces. As these interfaces become more expressive, we think of them as specifications of components or layers. Rich specifications based on formal logic are little used in industry today, but a practical platform for working with them could signicantly reduce the costs of system implementation and evolution by identifying vulnerabilities, helping programmers understand the behavior of new components, facilitating rigorous change-impact analysis, and supporting maintainable machine-checked verication that components are correct and fit together correctly. Recently, research in the area has begun to focus on a particularly rich class of specifications, which might be called deep specifications. Deep specifications are rich (describing complex component behaviors in detail); two-sided (connected to both implementations and clients); formal (written in a mathematical notation with clear semantics to support tools such as type checkers, analysis and testing tools, automated or machine-assisted provers, and advanced IDEs); and live (connected directly to the source code of implementations via machine-checkable proofs or property-based random testing). These requirements impose strong functional correctness conditions on individual components and permit them to be connected together with rigorous composition theorems. This talk presents the key features of deep specifications, surveys recent achievements and ongoing efforts in the research community (in particular, work at Penn, Princeton, Yale, and MIT on formalizing a rich interconnected collection of deep specifications for critical system software components), and argues that the time is ripe for an intensive effort in this area, involving both academia and industry and integrating research, education,and community building. The ultimate goal is to provide rigorously checked proofs about much larger artifacts than are feasible today, based on decomposition of proof effort across components with deep specifications.

Text as big data: Develop codes of practice for rigorous computational text analysis in energy social science	ENERGY RESEARCH & SOCIAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Computational text analysis; Big data; Automated content analysis; Text mining; Topic modeling; Discourse analysis	REPRODUCIBLE RESEARCH; CLIMATE-CHANGE; TOOL	Augmenting traditional social science methods with computational analysis is crucial if we are to exploit the vast digital archives of text data that have become available over the past two decades. In this journal, Benites-Lazaro et al. [1] showcase this in an application of topic modeling and other computational methods to an actor-specific examination of changes in policy discourse on ethanol in Brazil and point out methodological promises and challenges. However, their contribution also highlights the need for establishing codes of practice for computational text analysis. In this perspective, we discuss five areas for improvement when treating text as big data in light of guiding principles from computational research - transparency, reproducibility and validation - to facilitate rigorous research practice: (1) full transparency over data collection and corpus construction, (2) comprehensive method descriptions that enable reproducibility by other researchers, (3) application of rigorous model validation procedures, (4) results interpretation based on primary text and clear research design and (5) critical discussion and contextualization of main findings. We conclude that the energy social science community needs to develop codes of practice to build on the promising research within the field of computational text analysis and suggest first steps into this direction.

C	Morrisett, G		Audebaud, P; PaulinMohring, C		Morrisett, Greg			Programming with effects in Coq	MATHEMATICS OF PROGRAM CONSTRUCTION, PROCEEDINGS	LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Mathematics of Program Construction	JUL 15-18, 2008	Marseille, FRANCE	Ctr Int Rech Math Luminy, INRIA				Next-generation programming languages will move beyond simple type systems to include support for formal specifications and mechanically- checked proofs of adherence to those requirements. Already, in the imperative world, languages such as ESC/JAVA and SPEC# integrate Hoare- style pre- and post-conditions into the underlying type system. However, we argue that neither the program logics used in these systems, nor the decision procedures used to discharge verification conditions, are sufficient for establishing deep properties of modular software. In contrast, the COQ proof development environment provides a powerful program logic (CiC) coupled with an extensible, interactive environment that can combine deep insights from humans with automation to discharge deep proof obligations. Unfortunately, the language at the core of COQ is limited to purely functional programming. In the YNOT project, we are attempting to address this problem by extending CoQ with a new type constructor (the Hoare-triple type), and a few carefully chosen axioms that can be used to build imperative programs in a style quite close to HASKELL. I will report on our progress thus far, both in using YNOT to construct modular, extensible libraries for imperative programs, as well as our new compiler infrastructure for generating efficient code from YNOT programs.

In the context of social networking sites, transitivity threats refer to potential privacy policy breaches that stem from the automated transmission of data/content due to user actions within the social network. For example, commenting on some content within the social network makes the commented content visible to the recipients of the comment, thereby breaching the privacy policy under which the original/commented content was shared. This paper presents a novel approach for modelling and comparing social network privacy policies to deal with transitivity threats. Our approach differs from existing approaches in its use of formal methods techniques to compare social network privacy policies. This work builds on a predicate calculus definition for social networking, modelling social network content, people, friendship relations, and privacy policies as access permissions to content. We have implemented our approach as a tool called Poporo. The tool extends on a previous version of the Poporo tool that checked a third party application's compliance with system invariants. We validate our approach by using Poporo on several examples.

J	Providenti, M; Zai, R				Providenti, Michael; Zai, Robert, II			Web accessibility at Kentucky's academic libraries	LIBRARY HI TECH			English	Article						worldwide web; academic libraries; United States of America		Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide an update on the implementation of web accessibility guidelines at Kentucky academic library web sites. Design/methodology/approach - The academic library home pages of Bachelor-degree granting institutions of Kentucky were tested for accessibility compliance using an online automated program. In addition, a series of manual accessibility tests were performed. Data were collected on errors against accessibility guidelines for each site. Data collected in 2003 were compared to data collected in 2007. Findings - The number of library home pages complying with basic accessibility guidelines is increasing. However, most sites that score well are built to comply with checkpoints that can be tested automatically. Few institutions included accessibility features which required manual verification. Research limitations/implications - This study relies largely on data collected with an imperfect accessibility-checking software program. Some accessibility checkpoints can appear to be satisfied using automated accessibility tests despite the presence of accessibility barrier beings. Also, minor errors against accessibility guidelines are not distinguished from major accessibility barriers. Practical implications - This study provides an impetus for web developers to aim higher than the automated accessibility checkpoints. It demonstrates a limited number of manual accessibility checkpoints that can be objectively tested. Originality/value - This paper looks beyond accessibility guidelines that can be tested automatically to see if accessibility guidelines for which manual tests must be performed are being implemented. This study is one of the very few published follow-up studies of web accessibility.

To effectively analyse programmes built on top of software libraries, it is essential to have specifications for the library methods that can be easily processed by analysis tools. However, the availability of such specifications is seriously limited at the moment. Manually writing the specifications can be prohibitively expensive and error-prone, while existing automated approaches to inferring the specifications seldom produce results that are strong enough to be used in programme analysis. In this work, we propose the Doc2smt approach to generating strong functional constraints in SMT for library methods based on their documentations. Doc2smt first applies natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a set of rules to translate a method's natural language documentation into a large number of candidate constraint clauses in OCL. Then, it utilizes a manually enhanced domain model to identify OCL candidate constraint clauses that comply with the problem domain in static validation, translates well-formed OCL constraints into the SMT-LIB format, and checks whether each SMB-LIB constraint rightly abstracts the functionalities of the method under consideration via testing in dynamic validation. In the end, it reports the first functional constraint that survives both validations to the user as the result. We have implemented the approach into a supporting tool with the same name. In experiments conducted on 451 methods from the Java Collections Framework and the Java IO library, Doc2smt generated correct constraints for 309 methods, with the average generation time for each correct constraint being merely 2.7 min. We have also applied the generated constraints to facilitate symbolic-execution-based test generation with the Symbolic Java PathFinder (SPF) tool. For 24 utility methods manipulating Java container and IO objects, SPF with access to the generated constraints produced 51.2 times more test cases than SPF without the access.

Web browsers and other modern applications embed scripting engines to support interactive content. The scripting engines optimize performance via just-intime compilation. Since applications are increasingly hardened against code-reuse attacks, adversaries are looking to achieve code execution or elevate privileges by corrupting sensitive data like the intermediate representation of optimizing JIT compilers. This has inspired numerous defenses for just-in-time compilers. Our paper demonstrates that securing JIT compilation is not sufficient. First, we present a proof-of-concept data-only attack against a recent version of Mozilla's SpiderMonkey JIT in which the attacker only corrupts heap objects to successfully issue a system call from within bytecode execution at run time. Previous work assumed that bytecode execution is safe by construction since interpreters only allow a narrow set of benign instructions and bytecode is always checked for validity before execution. We show that this does not prevent malicious code execution in practice. Second, we design a novel defense, dubbed NoJITsu to protect complex, real-world scripting engines from data-only attacks against interpreted code. The key idea behind our defense is to enable fine-grained memory access control for individual memory regions based on their roles throughout the JavaScript lifecycle. For this we combine automated analysis, instrumentation, compartmentalization, and Intel's Memory-Protection Keys to secure SpiderMonkey against existing and newly synthesized attacks. We implement and thoroughly test our implementation using a number of real-world scenarios as well as standard benchmarks. We show that NoJITsu successfully thwarts code-reuse as well as data-only attacks against any part of the scripting engine while offering a modest run-time overhead of only 5%.

J	Yue, T; Ali, S				Yue, Tao; Ali, Shaukat			Empirically evaluating OCL and Java for specifying constraints on UML models	SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS MODELING			English	Article						OCL; Java; Controlled experiment; Empirical study; Constraints		The Object Constraint Language (OCL) has been applied, along with UML models, for various purposes such as supporting model-based testing, code generation, and automated consistency checking of UML models. However, a lot of challenges have been raised in the literature regarding its applicability in industry such as extensive training, slow learning curve, and significant effort to use OCL due to lack of familiarity of practitioners. To confirm these challenges, empirical evidence is needed, which is severely lacking in the literature. To build such preliminary evidence, we report a controlled experiment that was designed to evaluate OCL by comparing it with Java; a programming language that has also been used to specify constraints on UML models. Results show that the participants using OCL perform as good as the participants working with Java in terms of three objective quality metrics (i.e., completeness, conformance and redundancy) and two subjective metrics (i.e., applicability and confidence level). In addition, the participants using OCL performed consistently well for all the constraints of varying complexity, while fluctuating results were obtained for the participants using Java for the same constraints. Based on the empirical evidence, we can conclude that it does not make much difference to use OCL or Java for specifying constraints on UML models. However, the participants working with OCL performed consistently well on specifying constraints of varying complexity suggesting that OCL can be used to model complicated constraints (commonly observed in industrial applications) with the same quality as for simpler constraints. Moreover, additional analyses on the constraints when using Java and OCL tools revealed that tools are needed to specify fully correct constraints that can be used to support automation.

Nevertheless, due to state explosion, these tools still struggle to achieve scalability. Given a program, one way to reduce the number of states that the tools need to explore is to merge states obtained on different paths. Alas, doing so increases the size of symbolic path conditions (thereby stressing the underlying constraint solver) and interferes with optimizations of the exploration process (also referred to as search strategies). The net effect is that state merging may actually lower performance rather than increase it. We present a way to automatically choose when and how to merge states such that the performance of symbolic execution is significantly increased. First, we present query count estimation, a method for statically estimating the impact that each symbolic variable has on solver queries that follow a potential merge point; states are then merged only when doing so promises to be advantageous. Second, we present dynamic state merging, a technique for merging states that interacts favorably with search strategies in automated test case generation and bug finding tools. Experiments on the 96 GNU COREUTILS show that our approach consistently achieves several orders of magnitude speedup over previously published results. Our code and experimental data are publicly available at http://cloud9.epfl.ch.

J	Jezek, K; Dietrich, J; Brada, P				Jezek, Kamil; Dietrich, Jens; Brada, Premek			How Java APIs break - An empirical study	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Binary compatibility; API evolution; Backward compatibility; Byte-code; Java	COMPATIBILITY	Context: It has become common practice to build programs by using libraries. While the benefits of reuse are well known, an often overlooked risk are system runtime failures due to API changes in libraries that evolve independently. Traditionally, the consistency between a program and the libraries it uses is checked at build time when the entire system is compiled and tested. However, the trend towards partially upgrading systems by redeploying only evolved library versions results in situations where these crucial verification steps are skipped. For Java programs, partial upgrades create additional interesting problems as the compiler and the virtual machine use different rule sets to enforce contracts between the providers and the consumers of APIs. Objective: We have studied the extent of the problem in real world programs. We were interested in two aspects: the compatibility of API changes as libraries evolve, and the impact this has on programs using these libraries. Method: This study is based on the qualitas corpus version 20120401. A data set consisting of 109 Java open-source programs and 564 program versions was used from this corpus. We have investigated two types of library dependencies: explicit dependencies to embedded libraries, and dependencies defined by symbolic references in Maven build files that are resolved at build time. We have used JaCC for API analysis, this tool is based on the popular ASM byte code analysis library. Results: We found that for most of the programs we investigated, APIs are unstable as incompatible changes are common. Surprisingly, there are more compatibility problems in projects that use automated dependency resolution. However, we found only a few cases where this has an actual impact on other programs using such an API. Conclusion: It is concluded that API instability is common and causes problems for programs using these APIs. Therefore, better tools and methods are needed to safeguard library evolution.

J	Dolsek, M; Brozovic, M				Dolsek, Matjaz; Brozovic, Marko			Seismic response analysis using characteristic ground motion records for risk-based decision-making (3R method)	EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING & STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS			English	Article						seismic risk; target collapse risk; characteristic ground motions; ground motion selection; non-linear dynamic analysis; pushover analysis; risk-based decision-making; intensity-based assessment; reinforced concrete frame buildings	SELECTION	The concept of intensity-based assessment for risk-based decision-making is introduced. It is realized by means of the so-called 3R method (response analysis, record selection and risk-based decision-making), which can be used to check the adequacy of design of a new building or of the strengthening of an existing building by performing conventional pushover analysis and dynamic analysis for only a few ground motions, which are termed characteristic ground motions. Because the objective of the method is not a precise assessment of the seismic risk, a simple decision model for risk acceptability can be introduced. The engineer can decide that the reliability of a no-collapse requirement is sufficient when collapse is observed in the case of less than half of, for example, seven characteristic ground motions. From the theoretical point of view, it is shown that the accuracy of the method is acceptable if the non-linear response history analyses are performed at a low percentile of limit-state intensity, which is also proven by means of several examples of multi-storey reinforced concrete frame buildings. The 3R method represents a compromise between the exclusive use of either pushover analysis or dynamic analysis and can be easily introduced into building codes provided that its applicability is further investigated (e.g. asymmetric structures and other performance objectives) and that the procedure for the selection of characteristic ground motions is automated and readily available to engineers (www.smartengineering.si).

The goal of validation is to determine if the requirements are correct and complete, and validation is performed in the final system assessment phase. Nevertheless, the introduction of formal methods in model based engineering tends to blur the boundary between verification and validation, by allowing validation tasks to be performed early in the process, before the system has been fully designed and implemented. In particular, we consider recent work using constraint satisfaction techniques to perform formal verification and validation tasks at model level. The purpose of this article is twofold. First, we attempt to fit the existing methods and tools in a global design, verification and validation process. Second, we show that in addition to verification and validation, constraint based techniques can be used to automate part of the design activity itself, by synthesizing correct by construction and quantitatively optimal models from a specification.

J	Koo, B; Jung, R; Yu, Y				Koo, Bonsang; Jung, Raekyu; Yu, Youngsu			Automatic classification of wall and door BIM element subtypes using 3D geometric deep neural networks	ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS			English	Article						Building information modeling; Industry foundation classes; Semantic integrity; Deep learning; Machine learning	SEMANTIC ENRICHMENT; BUILDING ELEMENTS	With the growing adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM), specialized applications have been developed to perform domain-specific analyses. These applications need tailored information with respect to a BIM model element's attributes and relationships. In particular, architectural elements need further qualification concerning their geometric and functional 'subtypes' to support exact simulations and compliance checks. BIM and its underlying data schema, the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), provide a rich representation with which to exchange semantic entity and relationship data. However, subtypes for individual elements are not represented by default and often require manual designation, leaving it vulnerable to errors and omissions. Existing research to enrich the semantics of IFC model entities employed domain-specific rule sets that scrutinize their legitimacy and modify them, if and when necessary. However, such an approach is limited in their scalability and comprehensibility. This study explored the use of 3D geometric deep neural networks originating from computer vision research. Specifically, Multi-view CNN(MVCNN) and PointNet were investigated to determine their applicability in extracting unique features of door (IfcDoor) and wall (IfcWall) element subtypes, and in turn be leveraged to automate subtype classifications. Test results indicated MVCNN as having the best prediction performance, while PointNet's accuracy was hampered by resolution loss due to selective use of point cloud data. The research confirmed deep neural networks as a viable solution to distinguishing BIM element subtypes, the critical factor being their ability to detect subtle differences in local geometries.

However, developers often provide their own implementation of the standard SSL/TLS certificate validation process. Unfortunately, many such custom implementations have subtle bugs, have built-in exceptions for self-signed certificates, or blindly assert all certificates are valid, leaving many Android apps vulnerable to SSL/TLS Man-in-the-Middle attacks. In this paper, we present SMV-HUNTER, a system for the automatic, large-scale identification of such vulnerabilities that combines both static and dynamic analysis. The static component detects when a custom validation procedure has been given, thereby identifying potentially vulnerable apps, and extracts information used to guide the dynamic analysis, which then uses user interface enumeration and automation techniques to trigger the potentially vulnerable code under an active Man-in-the-Middle attack. We have implemented SMV-HUNTER and evaluated it on 23,418 apps downloaded from the Google Play market, of which 1,453 apps were identified as being potentially vulnerable by static analysis, with an average overhead of approximately 4 seconds per app, running on 16 threads in parallel. Among these potentially vulnerable apps, 726 were confirmed vulnerable using our dynamic analysis, with an average overhead of about 44 seconds per app, running on 8 emulators in parallel.

J	Dubois, C; Giorgetti, A				Dubois, Catherine; Giorgetti, Alain			Tests and proofs for custom data generators	FORMAL ASPECTS OF COMPUTING			English	Article						Interactive theorem proving; Random testing; Bounded-exhaustive testing; Logic programming; Combinatorial enumeration; Permutations; Rooted maps	CODE	We address automated testing and interactive proving of properties involving complex data structures with constraints, like the ones studied in enumerative combinatorics, e.g., permutations and maps. In this paper we show testing techniques to check properties of custom data generators for these structures. We focus on random property-based testing and bounded exhaustive testing, to find counterexamples for false conjectures in the Coq proof assistant. For random testing we rely on the existing Coq plugin QuickChick and its toolbox to write random generators. For bounded exhaustive testing, we use logic programming to generate all the data up to a given size. We also propose an extension of QuickChick with bounded exhaustive testing based on generators developed inside Coq, but also on correct-by-construction generators developed with Why3. These tools are applied to an original Coq formalization of the combinatorial structures of permutations and rooted maps, together with some operations on them and properties about them. Recursive generators are defined for each combinatorial family. They are used for debugging properties which are finally proved in Coq. This large case study is also a contribution in enumerative combinatorics.

The study was a retrospective cohort study of 506 eyes who underwent pars plana vitrectomy for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) by a single surgeon at a tertiary-care hospital between 2012 and 2019. Two ophthalmologists without coding experience used an interactive application in MATLAB to build and evaluate ML algorithms for the prediction of postoperative PVR using clinical data from the electronic health records. The clinical features associated with postoperative PVR were determined by univariate feature selection. The area under the curve (AUC) for predicting postoperative PVR was better for models that included pre-existing PVR as an input. The quadratic support vector machine (SVM) model built using all selected clinical features had an AUC of 0.90, a sensitivity of 63.0%, and a specificity of 97.8%. An optimized Naive Bayes algorithm that did not include pre-existing PVR as an input feature had an AUC of 0.81, a sensitivity of 54.3%, and a specificity of 92.4%. In conclusion, the development of ML models for the prediction of PVR by ophthalmologists without coding experience is feasible. Input from a data scientist might still be needed to tackle class imbalance-a common challenge in ML classification using real-world clinical data.

However, building a simulation model of a manufacturing system is a difficult task and needs great resource expenditures. Automated data collection and model buildup can drastically reduce the time of the design phase as well as support model reusability. Since most of the manufacturing systems are controlled by low level controllers (e.g., PLCs, CNCs) they store structure and control logic of the system to be modeled by a DES system. The paper introduces an ongoing research of PLC code processing method for automatic simulation model generation of a conveyor system of a leading automotive factory. Results of the validation process and simulation experiments are also described through a case study.

Although there is research that focuses on vulnerability prediction and discovery, there is still a need for building security-specific metrics to measure software security and vulnerability-proneness quantitatively. The existing methods are either based on software metrics (defined on the physical characteristics of code; e.g. complexity or lines of code) which are not security-specific or some generic patterns known as nano-patterns (Java method-level traceable patterns that characterize a Java method or function). Other methods predict vulnerabilities using text mining approaches or graph algorithms which perform poorly in cross-project validation and fail to be a generalized prediction model for any system. In this paper, we envision to construct an automated framework that will assist developers to assess the security level of their code and guide them towards developing secure code. To accomplish this goal, we aim to refine and redefine the existing nano-patterns and software metrics to make them more security-centric so that they can be used for measuring the software security level of a source code (either file or function) with higher accuracy. In this paper, we present our visionary approach through a series of three consecutive studies where we (1) will study the challenges of the current software metrics and nano-patterns in vulnerability prediction, (2) will redefine and characterize the nano-patterns and software metrics so that they can capture security-specific properties of code and measure the security level quantitatively, and finally (3) will implement an automated framework for the developers to automatically extract the values of all the patterns and metrics for the given code segment and then flag the estimated security level as a feedback based on our research results. We accomplished some preliminary experiments and presented the results which indicate that our vision can be practically implemented and will have valuable implications in the community of software security.

J	Chipounov, V; Kuznetsov, V; Candea, G				Chipounov, Vitaly; Kuznetsov, Volodymyr; Candea, George			The S2E Platform: Design, Implementation, and Applications	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER SYSTEMS			English	Article						Reliability; Verification; Performance; Security; Symbolic execution; testing; analysis; profiling		This article presents (SE)-E-2, a platform for analyzing the properties and behavior of software systems, along with its use in developing tools for comprehensive performance profiling, reverse engineering of proprietary software, and automated testing of kernel-mode and user-mode binaries. Conceptually, (SE)-E-2 is an automated path explorer with modular path analyzers: the explorer uses a symbolic execution engine to drive the target system down all execution paths of interest, while analyzers measure and/or check properties of each such path. (SE)-E-2 users can either combine existing analyzers to build custom analysis tools, or they can directly use (SE)-E-2's APIs. (SE)-E-2's strength is the ability to scale to large systems, such as a full Windows stack, using two new ideas: selective symbolic execution, a way to automatically minimize the amount of code that has to be executed symbolically given a target analysis, and execution consistency models, a way to make principled performance/accuracy trade-offs during analysis. These techniques give (SE)-E-2 three key abilities: to simultaneously analyze entire families of execution paths instead of just one execution at a time; to perform the analyses in-vivo within a real software stack-user programs, libraries, kernel, drivers, etc.-instead of using abstract models of these layers; and to operate directly on binaries, thus being able to analyze even proprietary software.

The TOTEM system is generated automatically through scripts using as input the detector Product Breakdown Structure (PBS) structure and its pinout connectivity, archiving and alarm meta-information, and some other heuristics based on the naming conventions. When those initial parameters and automation code are modified to include new features, the resulting PVSS system can also introduce side-effects. On a daily basis, a custom developed regression testing tool takes the most recent code from a Subversion (SVN) repository and builds a new control system from scratch. This system is exported in plain text format using the PVSS export tool, and compared with a system previously validated by a human. A report is sent to the developers with any differences highlighted, in readiness for validation and acceptance as a new stable version. This regression approach is not dependent on any development framework or methodology. This process has been satisfactory during several months, proving to be a very valuable tool before deploying new versions in the production systems.	[Rodriguez, F.

Automatic detection of inter-application permission leaks in Android applications	IBM JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article								The Android (R) operating system builds upon already well-established permission systems but complements them by allowing application components to be reused within and across applications through a single communication mechanism, called the Intent mechanism. In this paper, we describe techniques that we developed for statically detecting Android application vulnerability to attacks that obtain unauthorized access to permission-protected information. We address three kinds of such attacks, known as confused deputy, permission collusion, and Intent spoofing. We show that application vulnerability to these attacks can be detected using taint analysis. Based on this technique, we developed PermissionFlow, a tool for discovering vulnerabilities in the byte code and configuration of Android applications. To enable PermissionFlow analysis, we developed a static technique for automatic identification of permission-protected information sources in permission-based systems. This technique identifies application programming interfaces (APIs) whose execution leads to permission checking and considers these APIs to be sources of taint. Based on this approach, we developed Permission Mapper, a component of PermissionFlow that improves on previous work by performing fully automatic identification of such APIs for Android Java (R) code. Our automated analysis of popular applications found that 56% of the most popular 313 Android applications actively use intercomponent information flows. Among the tested applications, PermissionFlow found four exploitable vulnerabilities. By helping ensure the absence of inter-application permission leaks, we believe that the proposed analysis will be highly beneficial to the Android ecosystem and other mobile platforms that may use similar analyses in the future.

The current state-of-the-art in static developer assistance for tools like Docker is limited to shallow syntactic validation. We identify three core challenges in the realm of learning from, understanding, and supporting developers writing DevOps artifacts: (i) nested languages in DevOps artifacts, (ii) rule mining, and (iii) the lack of semantic rule-based analysis. To address these challenges we introduce a toolset, binnacle, that enabled us to ingest 900,000 GitHub repositories. Focusing on Docker, we extracted approximately 178,000 unique Dockerfiles, and also identified a Gold Set of Dockerfiles written by Docker experts. We addressed challenge (i) by reducing the number of effectively uninterpretable nodes in our ASTs by over 80% via a technique we call phased parsing. To address challenge (ii), we introduced a novel rule-mining technique capable of recovering two-thirds of the rules in a benchmark we curated. Through this automated mining, we were able to recover 16 new rules that were not found during manual rule collection. To address challenge (iii), we manually collected a set of rules for Dockerfiles from commits to the files in the Gold Set. These rules encapsulate best practices, avoid docker build failures, and improve image size and build latency. We created an analyzer that used these rules, and found that, on average, Dockerfiles on GitHub violated the rules five times more frequently than the Dockerfiles in our Gold Set. We also found that industrial Dockerfiles fared no better than those sourced from GitHub. The learned rules and analyzer in binnacle can be used to aid developers in the IDE when creating Dockerfiles, and in a post-hoc fashion to identify issues in, and to improve, existing Dockerfiles.

Such functionalities are programmable by software and contain a multitude of parameters necessary for their configuration, which have been increasing due to the market diversification and customer demand. In addition, industrial products are often built by aggregating different software parts (components), constituting thus product variants. Product variants with such variability need to be tested adequately, in particular if one is concerned with security vulnerabilities. While efficient automated testing approaches already exist, such as fuzzing, no tool is able to use results from previous testing campaigns to increase the efficiency of security testing the next product variant that shares certain functionalities. This paper presents an approach that can ignore already covered functionalities by previous tests and give more importance to blocks of code that have yet to be checked. The benefit is to avoid repeating unnecessary work, hence increasing the speed and the coverage in the new variant. The approach was implemented in a tool based on the AFL fuzzer and was validated with a set of programs of different versions.

By impersonating trusted email senders through carefully crafted messages and spoofed metadata, adversaries can trick victims into launching attachments containing malicious code or into clicking on malicious links that grant attackers a foothold into otherwise well-protected networks. Spearphishing is effective because it is fundamentally difficult for users to distinguish legitimate emails from spearphishing emails without additional defensive mechanisms. However, such mechanisms, such as cryptographic signatures, have found limited use in practice due to their perceived difficulty of use for normal users. In this paper, we present a novel automated approach to defending users against spearphishing attacks. The approach first builds probabilistic models of both email metadata and stylometric features of email content. Then, subsequent emails are compared to these models to detect characteristic indicators of spearphishing attacks. Several instantiations of this approach are possible, including performing model learning and evaluation solely on the receiving side, or senders publishing models that can be checked remotely by the receiver. Our evaluation of a real data set drawn from 20 email users demonstrates that the approach effectively discriminates spearphishing attacks from legitimate email while providing significant ease-of-use benefits over traditional defenses.

Smart Diagnose Procedure for Data Acquisition Systems Inside Dams	2014 IEEE 20TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM FOR DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY IN ELECTRONIC PACKAGING (SIITME)	International Symposium for Design and Technology in Electronic Packaging		English	Proceedings Paper	20th IEEE International Symposium on Design and Technology in Electronic Packaging (SIITME)	OCT 23-26, 2014	Bucharest, ROMANIA	IEEE, IEEE CPMT Hu & Ro Joint Chapter, Politechnica Univ Bucharest, CETTI, IEEE Romania Sect		diagnose; dam; sensor; protocol; system		This scientific paper reveals an intelligent system for data acquisition for dam monitoring and diagnose. This system is built around the RS485 communication standard and uses its own communication protocol [2]. The aim of the system is to monitor all signal levels inside the communication bus, respectively to detect the out of action data loggers. The diagnose test extracts the following functional parameters: supply voltage and the absolute value and common mode value for differential signals used in data transmission (denoted with "A" and "B"). Analyzing this acquired information, it's possible to find short-circuits or open-circuits across the communication bus. The measurement and signal processing functions, for flaws, are implemented inside the system's central processing unit. The next testing step is finding the out of action data loggers and is being made by trying to communicate with every data logger inside the network The lack of any response from a data logger is interpreted as an error and using the code of the data logger's microcontroller, it is possible to find its exact position inside the dam infrastructure. The novelty of this procedure is the fact that it completely automates the diagnose procedure, which, until now, was made visually by checking every data logger.

We note that models are built from a system perspective, and resources are allocated to meet communication, energy or scheduling constraints. Yet, it is seldom optimal. In this paper, we explore transformations applied at model-level that preserve schedulability of the system, yet reduce the overall resource consumption. We use A AD L as input formalism. By automating this process, we show how to transition from a system view to an implementation view, closer to actual hardware constraints.

Domain-specific modelling (DSM) in particular allows to specify these models in a domain-specific modelling language (DSML), using concepts and notations of a specific domain. It allows the use of a custom visual syntax which is closer to the problem domain and therefore more intuitive. Models created in DSMLs are used, among others, for simulation, (formal) analysis, documentation, and code synthesis for different platforms. The goal is to enable domain experts, such as a power plant engineer, to develop, to understand, and to verify models more easily, without having to use concepts outside of their own domain. The first step in the DSM approach when modelling in a new domain is, after a domain analysis, creating an appropriate DSML. In this chapter, we give an introduction to DSML engineering and show how it can be used to develop a human-computer interaction interface. A DSML is fully defined by its syntax and semantics. The syntax consists of (i) the abstract syntax, defining the DSML constructs and their allowed combinations, captured in a metamodel, and (ii) the concrete syntax, specifying the visual representation of the different constructs. The semantics defines the meaning of models created in the domain. In this chapter, we show how two types of semantics (operational and translational) can be modelled using model transformations. Operational semantics gives meaning to the modelling language by continuously updating the model's state, effectively building a simulator. Translational semantics defines mappings of models in one language onto models in a language with known semantics. This enables the automatic construction of behavioural models, as well as models for verification. The former can be used for automated code synthesis (leading to a running application), whereas the latter leads to model checking. We choose to specify properties for model checking using the ProMoBox approach, which allows the modelling of properties in a syntax similar to the original DSML. A major advantage of this approach is that the modeller specifies both requirements (in the form of properties) and design models in a familiar notation. The properties modelled in this domain-specific syntax are verified by mapping them to lower-level languages, such as Promela, and results are mapped back to the domain-specific level. To illustrate the approach, we create a DSML for modelling the human-computer interaction interface of a nuclear power plant.

Frames belong to 124 full movies from the entire filmographies by 6 important directors: Martin Scorsese, Jean-Luc Godard, Bela Tarr, Federico Fellini, Michelangelo Antonioni, and Ingmar Bergman. Each frame, extracted from videos at 1 frame per second, is annotated on the following scale categories: Extreme Close Up (ECU), Close Up (CU), Medium Close Up (MCU), Medium Shot (MS), Medium Long Shot (MLS), Long Shot (LS), Extreme Long Shot (ELS), Foreground Shot (FS), and Insert Shots (IS). Two independent coders annotated all frames from the 124 movies, whilst a third one checked their coding and made decisions in cases of disagreement. The CineScale database enables AI-driven interpretation of shot scale data and opens to a large set of research activities related to the automatic visual analysis of cinematic material, such as the automatic recognition of the director's style, or the unfolding of the relationship between shot scale and the viewers' emotional experience. To these purposes, we also provide the model and the code for building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for automated shot scale recognition.

Tracking and coordinating an international curation effort for the CCDS Project	DATABASE-THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DATABASES AND CURATION			English	Article							MESSENGER-RNA DECAY; OPEN READING FRAMES; INITIATION; TRANSLATION; ANNOTATION; CONSERVATION; TRANSCRIPTS; PROKARYOTES; EXPRESSION; MECHANISM	The Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) collaboration involves curators at multiple centers with a goal of producing a conservative set of high quality, protein-coding region annotations for the human and mouse reference genome assemblies. The CCDS data set reflects a 'gold standard' definition of best supported protein annotations, and corresponding genes, which pass a standard series of quality assurance checks and are supported by manual curation. This data set supports use of genome annotation information by human and mouse researchers for effective experimental design, analysis and interpretation. The CCDS project consists of analysis of automated whole-genome annotation builds to identify identical CDS annotations, quality assurance testing and manual curation support. Identical CDS annotations are tracked with a CCDS identifier (ID) and any future change to the annotated CDS structure must be agreed upon by the collaborating members. CCDS curation guidelines were developed to address some aspects of curation in order to improve initial annotation consistency and to reduce time spent in discussing proposed annotation updates. Here, we present the current status of the CCDS database and details on our procedures to track and coordinate our efforts. We also present the relevant background and reasoning behind the curation standards that we have developed for CCDS database treatment of transcripts that are nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) candidates, for transcripts containing upstream open reading frames, for identifying the most likely translation start codons and for the annotation of readthrough transcripts. Examples are provided to illustrate the application of these guidelines.

Though verbal methods (i.e., pain scales, questionnaires) and visual analogue scales are commonly used for measuring clinical pain, they tend to lack in reliability or validity when applied to mentally impaired individuals. Expression of pain and/or its biopotential parameters could represent a solution. While such coding systems already exist, they are either very costly and time-consuming, or have been insufficiently evaluated with regards to the theory of mental tests. Building on the experiences made to date, we collected a database using visual and biopotential signals to advance an automated pain recognition system, to determine its theoretical testing quality, and to optimize its performance. For this purpose, participants were subjected to painful heat stimuli under controlled conditions.

BIM data interoperability issues, including lack of a clear understanding of owner's exchange requirements (ERs), inconsistent syntax in developing discipline-specific models, and software limitations contribute to the difficulty of using architecture, engineering, and construction-purposed BIMs for FM handover. This research explores a case-based example of implementing computational BIM for automatic verification of an FM-handover BIM at project close out. The relationships between, and properties of, model objects used to capture the required geometric and non-geometric information for the owner's needs at project close out are specified in accordance with the applicable IFC concepts. The terminologies and taxonomies are formalized in conjunction with the buildingSMART Data Dictionary (bsDD) schema. Dynamo is used as a visual programming platform to work with the Autodesk Revit application programming interface (API) to extend its parametric capabilities for automatic verification of BIM data in compliance with the specified requirements. The results of the automated verification procedure highlight completeness, uniqueness, correctness, usefulness, and unambiguity of BIM data as critical quality dimensions for the purpose of project delivery.

C	Le, TDB; Thung, F; Lo, D			IEEE	Le, Tien-Duy B.; Thung, Ferdian; Lo, David			Predicting Effectiveness of IR-Based Bug Localization Techniques	2014 IEEE 25TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON SOFTWARE RELIABILITY ENGINEERING (ISSRE)	Proceedings International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	25th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE)	NOV 03-06, 2014	Naples, ITALY	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, CISCO, DIETI UNINA, CRITIWARE s r l, ResilTech, AdaCore				Recently, many information retrieval (IR) based bug localization approaches have been proposed in the literature. These approaches use information retrieval techniques to process a textual bug report and a collection of source code files to find buggy files. They output a ranked list of files sorted by their likelihood to contain the bug. Recent approaches can achieve reasonable accuracy, however, even a state-of-the-art bug localization tool outputs many ranked lists where buggy files appear very low in the lists. This potentially causes developers to distrust bug localization tools. Parnin and Orso recently conduct a user study and highlight that developers do not find an automated debugging tool useful if they do not find the root cause of a bug early in a ranked list. To address this problem, we build an oracle that can automatically predict whether a ranked list produced by an IR-based bug localization tool is likely to be effective or not. We consider a ranked list to be effective if a buggy file appears in the top-N position of the list. If a ranked list is unlikely to be effective, developers do not need to waste time in checking the recommended files one by one. In such cases, it is better for developers to use traditional debugging methods or request for further information to localize bugs. To build this oracle, our approach extracts features that can be divided into four categories: score features, textual features, topic model features, and metadata features. We build a separate prediction model for each category, and combine them to create a composite prediction model which is used as the oracle. We name our proposed approach APRILE, which stands for Automated PRediction of IR-based Bug Localization's Effectiveness. We have evaluated APRILE to predict the effectiveness of three state-of-the-art IR-based bug localization tools on more than three thousands bug reports from AspectJ, Eclipse, and SWT. APRILE can achieve an average precision, recall, and F-measure of at least 70.36%, 66.94%, and 68.03%, respectively. Furthermore, APRILE outperforms a baseline approach by 84.48%, 17.74%, and 31.56% for the AspectJ, Eclipse, and SWT bug reports, respectively.

C	Ahn, S; Malik, S			IEEE	Ahn, Sunha; Malik, Sharad			Automated Firmware Testing using Firmware-Hardware Interaction Patterns	2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HARDWARE/SOFTWARE CODESIGN AND SYSTEM SYNTHESIS (CODES+ISSS)			English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Hardware / Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS)	NOV 12-17, 2014	New Delhi, INDIA					Firmware is low-level software which can directly access hardware and is often shipped with the hardware platform. This component of the system is increasing in scale and importance, and thus firmware validation is a critical part of system validation. Firmware validation relies on the interacting hardware components which are usually not available until the late design stages. This is generally addressed through co-simulating C/C++ based firmware code and HDL hardware models (including SystemC). However, this tends to be slow, and is further exacerbated by the large number of possible interleavings between the concurrent firmware and hardware threads. Typically, in the co-simulation, the scheduler, such as the SystemC scheduler, will only explore a single, or at best a small number of possible firmware-hardware interleavings and thus may miss critical bugs. In this paper we present an alternative approach to firmware validation that is based on automatically generating a test-set for the firmware with the goal of complete path coverage while considering its interactions with hardware and other firmware threads. It uses a service-function based Transaction Level Model (TLM) which has been used in the past for firmware hardware codesign. The test generation is based on concolic testing which has been used successfully in software test generation. However, existing concolic testing tools are used for test-generation of sequential code, and cannot directly consider the interaction of other hardware/firmware threads with the target firmware thread during test generation. We address this limitation by exploiting specific interaction patterns between the firmware and hardware threads that can be analyzed from the TLM. We show how these patterns, along with the firmware and hardware threads are used to automatically generate a sequential program that is test-equivalent to the target firmware transaction and that can be used with a standard sequential program concolic test generator. The tests generated can be (i) directly used for the firmware transaction and (ii) account for the multi-threaded interactions. These interaction patterns are practically relevant as they occur often in practice in real firmware benchmarks such as Linux device driver code, and its interacting QEMU emulated hardware code. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our techniques for these benchmarks through a practical implementation that is automated and built on top of Frama-C, a static code analyzer, and KLEE, a concolic testing tool.

An important aspect of this concept is the development and use of Digital Twins. A Digital Twin is a digital representation of a product or process that is used to optimize the design and use of said product or process. In this opinion article, we show that such Digital Twins have already been developed for a variety of tissue engineering processes. Using skeletal tissue engineering as a case study, we discuss a number of models at various stages of use between bench and bedside and ranging from pure data-driven models to models built on known mechanisms and first principles. Finally, we emphasize the importance of data collection and model validation to ensure, amongst others, compliance to regulatory guidelines.

The prevalent practice of manual coding, carried out by trained medical coders, is error-prone and time-consuming. Mitigating this labor-intensive process by developing diagnostic coding systems built on patients' Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) is vital. However, developing nations with low digitization rates have limited availability of structured EMRs, thereby necessitating a need for systems that leverage unstructured data sources. Despite the rich clinical information available in such unstructured data, modeling them is complex, owing to the variety and sparseness of diagnostic codes, complex structural and temporal nature of summaries, and prolific use of medical jargon. This work proposes a context-attentive network to facilitate automatic diagnostic code assignment as a multi-label classification problem. The proposed model facilitates information aggregation across a patient's discharge summary via multi-channel, variable-sized convolutional filters to extract multi-granular snippets. The attention mechanism enables selecting vital segments in those snippets that map to the clinical codes. The model's superior performance underscores its effectiveness compared to the state-of-the-art on the MIMIC-III database. Additionally, experimental validation using the CodiEsp dataset exhibited the model's interpretability and explainability. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Monitoring perfectly meets principles and guidelines of the recently issued Italian and European seismic codes as it is considered a strategic activity in the knowledge process of historic buildings, in order to understand their structural behavior and have a deeper insight on their health conditions. Thanks to SHM it is possible to intervene on buildings with more confidence (and only when necessary), but also to prevent the execution of intrusive strengthening interventions, in full compliance with the minimum intervention principle, so important in the restoration field. The object of monitoring is to identify, locate and classify type and severity of damages induced by external actions or degradation phenomena and to assess their effects on the structural performance. In this way it is possible to take appropriate measures to reduce the danger of collapse and, when necessary, perform strengthening interventions to improve the structural and seismic capacity. Motivated by the above reasons, the paper provide a contribution to the application of integrated methodologies and techniques, based on SHM, for the assessment and protection of cultural heritage (CH) buildings and existing structures. Selected case studies, equipped with distributed sensors and acquisition systems, allowed the definition and successive validation of SHM as a knowledge-based assessment tool, implemented to: (1) avoid the execution of unnecessary interventions and assess structural vulnerabilities; (2) evaluate intervention needs, following an incremental approach during their execution; (3) control the damage states of buildings in a post-seismic scenario. Monitoring data, automatically processed through dedicated software for static monitoring and automated algorithms for modal parameters extraction, are then used for the assessment of the health conditions and the identification of active damaging processes based on numerical simulations and robust statistical models.

Human analysts must vet candidate traceability links retrieved by such tools and must often go looking for links that such tools fail to locate as they build a traceability matrix. This paper examines a research version of the traceability tool REquirements TRacing On target (RETRO) that logs analyst actions. We examine the user logs in order to understand how analysts work on traceability recovery tasks. Such information is a pre-requisite to understanding how to better design traceability tools to best utilize analyst time while developing a high quality final traceability matrix.

The events need to be coded with an event type and annotated with entities from a domain specific ontology for future retrieval and analysis. The problem is dynamic in nature, characterised by new or changing groups and targets, and the emergence of new types of events. A number of automated event extraction systems exist that detect thousands of events on a daily basis. The resulting datasets, however, lack sufficient coverage of specific domains and suffer from too many duplicated and irrelevant events. Therefore expert event coding and validation is required to ensure sufficient quality and coverage of a conflict. We propose a new framework for semi-automatic rule-based event extraction and coding based on the use of deep syntactic-semantic patterns created from normal user input to an event annotation system. The method is implemented in a prototype Event Coding Assistant that processes news articles to suggest relevant events to a user who can correct or accept the suggestions. Over time as a knowledge base of patterns is built, event extraction accuracy improves and, as shown by analysis of system logs, the workload of the user is decreased.

Building these tools on top of (SE)-E-2 took less than 770 LOC and 40 person-hours each. (SE)-E-2's novelty consists of its ability to scale to large real systems, such as a full Windows stack. (SE)-E-2 is based on two new ideas: selective symbolic execution, a way to automatically minimize the amount of code that has to be executed symbolically given a target analysis, and relaxed execution consistency models, a way to make principled performance/precision trade-offs in complex analyses. These techniques give (SE)-E-2 three key abilities: to simultaneously analyze entire families of execution paths, instead of just one execution at a time; to perform the analyses in-vivo within a real software stack-user programs, libraries, kernel, drivers, etc.-instead of using abstract models of these layers; and to operate directly on binaries, thus being able to analyze even proprietary software. Conceptually, (SE)-E-2 is an automated path explorer with modular path analyzers: the explorer drives the target system down all execution paths of interest, while analyzers check properties of each such path (e. g., to look for bugs) or simply collect information (e. g., count page faults). Desired paths can be specified in multiple ways, and one can either combine existing analyzers to build a custom analysis tool, or write new analyzers using the (SE)-E-2 API.

An underlying aspect is the effectiveness of assigning priorities: if the priorities of a fair number of bugs are changed, it indicates delays in fixing critical bugs. There has been little prior work on understanding the dynamics of changing bug priorities. In this paper, we performed an empirical study to observe and understand the changes in bugs' priority to build a 3-W model on Why and When bug priorities change, and Who performs the change. We conducted interviews and a survey with practitioners as well as performed a quantitative analysis containing 225,000 bug reports, developers' comments, and source code changes from 24 open-source systems. The interviews with 11 developers from industry aim to establish an initial model to characterize the changes in bugs priority. The survey with an additional 38 developers was to understand their experience in why and when bug priorities change, and who performs the change. Then, we conducted a manual inspection of the collected data on open-source projects to compare our final bugs priority change model with changes identified in practice. Our quantitative results confirmed the outcomes of our interviews and surveys. For instance, we observed frequent changes in bug priorities and their impact on delaying critical bug fixes especially just before shipping a new release. Our findings can enable 1) researchers to build automated tools for checking and validating requests for bug priority changes, 2) practitioners to use a standard format in documenting and approving bug priority changes, and 3) educators to teach the better management of bug priorities.

BCH codes are most common error-correcting codes that are used in many data transmission systems for detecting and correcting errors. BCH-codes with short-length of codewords and with a small number of correcting bits are used in automation systems of production. The code that implemented in the article has the following parameters: - n = 15 - the length of the input code combination; - m = 7 - the length of the information block; - k = 8 - the length of the message control block; - t = 2 - the number of errors, that code corrects; - d = 5 - the maximum Hamming distance between two combinations; - g (x) - 111010001 - the generating polynomial. The paper describes implementations of two simplest decoding methods: a tabular, that based on the application of a table with precalculated errors syndromes; and cyclic, that based on the checking of the weight of remainder of the division of the codeword by the generating polynomial. The simplest implementation is the tabular decoding method. The basis of this method is the table, which stores all possible values of error patterns up to the multiplicity oft. Addresses of error patterns are error syndromes. Having such the table, the decoding process is reduced to selecting a pattern from the table at the address, which is equal to the remainder of the division of the input codeword by the generating polynomial. The error pattern that was selected from the table is summed up modulo two with the input codeword. The corrected codeword arrives to the output of the decoder. The main drawback of this method it is the necessary to build the table and connect additional FPGA resources to store this table. The second decoding method, which is easy to implement, is a cyclic method. This decoding method was designed for codes with the cyclicity property, and it suitable for BCH-codes. This method based on the checking the condition w <= t of the remainder of the division the input codeword by the generating polynomial. For the first implementations of these methods, the process of division the input codeword by the generating polynomial is performed using a linear feedback register (LROS), and have a clear sequential structure. The maximum number of cycles required for the decoding process in devices, which was implemented based on table decoding methods is 36 cycles with frequency 275.2 MHz. And for decoder based on cyclic decoding method it is necessary 627 cycles with frequency 192.8. The first modification was the using of the parallel structure is used instead of the sequential one, for the decoder based on the cyclic decoding method, to improve the performance. In this case, the number of cycles decreased from 627 and frequency192.8 MHz to 45 cycles with frequency 179.3 MHz. In order to make it possible to overcome the limit of the number of cycles, in accordance with Amdahl's law, was using a modification at the level of the used algorithms. For that, the classical procedure of polynomials division was replaced by the matrix division. It allows to perform the process of division the input codeword by the generator polynomial in 1 - 2 cycles. Such a replacement allowed reducing the number of cycles in implementations from 36 cycles with frequency 275.2 to 7 cycles with frequency 275.2 MHz; from 627 cycles with frequency 192.8 MHz to 192 cycles with frequency 200.1 MHz and in the end from 45 cycles with frequency 179.3 MHz to 16 cycles with frequency 174.1 MHz. The latest modification was a changing of the design logic of devices. It was used for the decoder which based on the cyclic decoding method, had the parallel structure and matrix division of polynomials. For that decoder which based on a combinational logic it is enough the 1 cycle for decoding procedure. In this article are given a summary table of results by the main characteristics of implemented devices, and it also has a full description of all the values, which are given in that table.

Static analysis approaches have been proposed for different tasks, including for assessing the security of Android apps, detecting app clones, automating test cases generation, or for uncovering non-functional issues related to performance or energy. The literature thus has proposed a large body of works, each of which attempts to tackle one or more of the several challenges that program analyzers face when dealing with Android apps. Objective: We aim to provide a clear view of the state-of-the-art works that statically analyze Android apps, from which we highlight the trends of static analysis approaches, pinpoint where the focus has been put, and enumerate the key aspects where future researches are still needed. Method: We have performed a systematic literature review (SLR) which involves studying 124 research papers published in software engineering, programming languages and security venues in the last 5 years (January 2011-December 2015). This review is performed mainly in five dimensions: problems targeted by the approach, fundamental techniques used by authors, static analysis sensitivities considered, android characteristics taken into account and the scale of evaluation performed. Results: Our in-depth examination has led to several key findings: 1) Static analysis is largely performed to uncover security and privacy issues; 2) The Soot framework and the Jimple intermediate representation are the most adopted basic support tool and format, respectively; 3) Taint analysis remains the most applied technique in research approaches; 4) Most approaches support several analysis sensitivities, but very few approaches consider path-sensitivity; 5) There is no single work that has been proposed to tackle all challenges of static analysis that are related to Android programming; and 6) Only a small portion of state-of-the-art works have made their artifacts publicly available. Conclusion: The research community is still facing a number of challenges for building approaches that are aware altogether of implicit-Flows, dynamic code loading features, reflective calls, native code and multi-threading, in order to implement sound and highly precise static analyzers.

Review of the approaches	VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-UPRAVLENIE VYCHISLITELNAJA TEHNIKA I INFORMATIKA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CONTROL AND COMPUTER SCIENCE			Russian	Review						design pattern; antipattern; data analysis; UML	PATTERN DETECTION; RECOVERY	In this paper, the review of the literature dedicated to the detection of the different artifacts (patterns, defects, errors, antipatterns and etc.) in software source code, documentation and other information sources is given. The systematization of the approaches on several grounds is achieved. In the study approaches the following artifacts can be used as the purpose for the search: 1. Design patterns. Patterns detection in the source code is important part of the reverse design. The automation of this process makes it possible to significantly increase the quality of the collected information and to decrease both time and material costs. 2. Antipatterns, design principle violations, code defects. Antipatterns and other design defects detection makes it possible to increase the quality of developed applications. 3. Micro pattern is traceable patterns, which are limited by the one class/interface. Their detection creates foundation for determining more complex constructions. Secondly, the classification of approaches is based on the data source for conducting the analysis. There are 3 types of the analysis in the literature: 1. The static analysis is the analysis of the source code and documentation. Programming languages Java and C++ are the most popular for source code writing. Also, some researchers use UML-diagrams as documentation for analysis. 2. The dynamic analysis is that of application in runtime. Java-bytecode is used as the source data. 3. The combined analysis is combination of static and dynamic analysis. The static analysis of the source code is used for the detection of "candidates", dynamic analysis is used for checking "candidates" if they correspond to one or another design pattern. The following detection strategies are proposed in the study approaches: 1. Metrics. 2. Graphs. 3. Visual analysis. 4. Bayesian Belief Networks. 5. Java-annotations. 6. Predicates. 7. Bit arrays operations. 8. Analysis of textual representation of visual language. Besides those enumerated above, researchers proposed the different methods of the manual detection of artifacts. The corresponding realizations were developed by authors on the base of several described approaches. The most of them are IDE Eclipse plugins and analyses Java source code. Open source code of popular frameworks (JHotDraw and etc.) is used for testing such plugins. Approaches for antipatterns detection so have several realizations. Besides plugins for source code analysis, the approach realization for design patterns refactoring in UML-diagrams is accessible in the Internet. The analysis of literature showed that the DPD issue is sufficiently popular. The procedures proposed by researchers have both advantages and disadvantages. The main disadvantage in the majority of the approaches proposed is dependence on the concrete programming language. It is necessary to perform work in the domain of the analysis of UML- diagrams and others language information sources, which are independent of the realization.

Web sites require care in configuration and programming to assure security, confidentiality, and trustworthiness of the published information. SQL-injection attacks exploit weak validation of textual input used to build database queries. Maliciously crafted input may threaten the confidentiality and the security policies of Web sites relying on a database to store and retrieve. information. This paper presents an original approach that combines static analysis, dynamic analysis, and code re-engineering to automatically protect applications written in PHP from SQL-injection attacks The paper also reports preliminary results of experiments performed on an old SQL-injection prone version of phpBB (version 2.0.0, 37193 LOC of PHP version 4.2.2 code). Results show that our approach successfully improved phpBB-2.0.0 resistance to SQL-injection attacks.

The exchange of healthcare data in compliance with the medical privacy law requires experts with deep familiarity of its intricate provisions for verification. The article presents a medical relational model (MRM) for the extraction of logical rules from medical law, required to design a medical decision support system (MDSS) that facilitates the process of exchanging data electronically with minimum human intervention. The division of medical law into small concept classes makes it easier to formalize the legal text of medical law into logical rules. These logical rules are then used to make a precise decision in compliance with the law, after evaluating requests from different entities for different purposes in MDSS. Our methodology is to analyze the legal text and release records in compliance with the medical law. For developing countries where medical laws are not as mature as HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) in the USA, the proposed methodology can be adapted to build their MDSS based on MRM.

These sequences are very useful at IP level verification but at SoC level verification where number of registers are very large, these sequences take very long time to run. Similarly, currently users require strong knowledge of SystemVerilog UVM language to use UVM_REG register model and verification environment code seems to be very complex to verification engineers/designers which are not expert in UVM. Some limitations in current version of UVM_REG package like no automatic data checking for memory accesses and limited support for memory burst operation were also seen. In this paper, we are describing how we addressed the above mentioned issues. We are accessing processor programmable registers and memories through a standard API (based on UVM_REG register model) used in test development. This API is aimed at writing simpler directed tests which require less or no SystemVerilog/UVM understanding. This API can be used to facilitate dumping register access for reuse from IP to SoC, or format outputs for use in ATE test vectors development etc. In these APIs, basic to more complex OS based capability is provided. We also developed our own register/memory sequences to address the SoC level register and memory testing. Customized code is written to enhance the features of standard UVM_REG Register and Memory Model. IP-XACT based tools are also developed to automatically generate all required verification environment files for using standard register model. Verification Environments with UVM_REG register model integrated are used to verify a variety of devices covering various protocols, applications and domains as the Internet of Things (IoT).

For over 10 years of development it has evolved into a factory for automatic release production and grid distribution. The 50 multi-platform branches of ATLAS releases provide vast opportunities for testing new packages, verification of patches to existing software, and migration to new platforms and compilers for ATLAS code that currently contains 2200 packages with 4 million C++ and 1.4 million python scripting lines written by about 1000 developers. Recent development was focused on the integration of ATLAS Nightly Build and Installation systems. The nightly releases are distributed and validated and some are transformed into stable releases used for data processing worldwide. The ATLAS Nightly System is managed by the NICOS control tool on a computing farm with 50 powerful multiprocessor nodes. NICOS provides the fully automated framework for the release builds, testing, and creation of distribution kits. The ATN testing framework of the Nightly System runs unit and integration tests in parallel suites, fully utilizing the resources of multi-core machines, and provides the first results even before compilations complete. The NICOS error detection system is based on several techniques and classifies the compilation and test errors according to their severity. It is periodically tuned to place greater emphasis on certain software defects by highlighting the problems on NICOS web pages and sending automatic e-mail notifications to responsible developers. These and other recent developments will be presented and future plans will be described.

M-site is the term associated with a website that is meant for mobile device. Since the characteristics of websites and m-sites are different, most mobile sites are built from scratch. Since there are some common features and technologies for developing website and mobile site, a tool (Automated Mobile Site Creator) is being proposed as a solution and it will automatically produce an M-commerce site given an E-Commerce website. After analysing the structure websites on the Web, it can be concluded that 90% of them are developed using 5 main parts which involve HTML (Web information and Structure), CSS (Presentation), JavaScript (Validation), Picture Compression and PHP (Database Interaction). A 5-Step Approach is used in by the automated tool: (1) the entire HTML tags are converted to XHTML, (2) The CSS files become different WCSS files, (3) High resolution pictures are compressed into adapted resolution, (4) JavaScript and PHP are both converted as Mobile Ajax codes and (5) for the Database, an Interface is created to allow aggregation of the data stored into a universal model that suits the template of our tool. These are the five important parts that will build up the m-commerce site. The Automated M-Commerce Site Creator converts a whole site by following all links from the homepage. As such the conversion process is a bit time consuming, however once implemented the loading time of m-commerce site compared to the e-commerce website in a mobile phone is approximately 2 times quicker on average.

With 66,609 instances to check across three versions of Linux, the naive approach of simply dividing up the code and assigning it to students does not scale, and does little to educate. However, by teaching and applying analytical reasoning, the instances can be categorized effectively, the problems of scale can be managed, and students can collaborate and compete with one another to achieve an unprecedented level of verification. We refer to our approach as Evidence-Enabled Collaborative Verification (EECV). A key aspect of this approach is the use of visual software models, which provide mathematically rigorous and critical evidence for verification. The visual models make analytical reasoning interactive, interesting and applicable to large software. Visual models are generated automatically using a tool we have developed called L-SAP [14]. This tool generates an Instance Verification Kit (IVK) for each instance, which contains all of the verification evidence for the instance. The L-SAP tool is implemented on a software graph database platform called Atlas [6]. This platform comes with a powerful query language and interactive visualization to build and apply visual models for software verification. The course project is based on three recent versions of the Linux operating system with altogether 37 MLOC and 66,609 verification instances.

How People Really (Like To) Work Comparative Process Mining to Unravel Human Behavior	HUMAN-CENTERED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING, HCSE 2014	Lecture Notes in Computer Science		English	Proceedings Paper	5th IFIP WG 13.2 International Conference on Human-Centered Software Engineering (HCSE)	SEP 16-18, 2014	Univ Paderborn, Software Qual Lab, Paderborn, GERMANY	Int Federat Informat Proc Working Grp 13 2 Methodologies User Centered Syst Design, Paderborn Uberzeugt, Software Innovat Campus Paderborn, C Lab, SFB 901, Its Owl, Paderborn Ist Informatik, Int Federat Informat Proc Tech Comm 13 Human Comp Interact	Univ Paderborn, Software Qual Lab			Software forms an integral part of the most complex artifacts built by humans. Communication, production, distribution, healthcare, transportation, banking, education, entertainment, government, and trade all increasingly rely on systems driven by software. Such systems may be used in ways not anticipated at design time as the context in which they operate is constantly changing and humans may interact with them an unpredictable manner. However, at the same time, we are able to collect unprecedented collections of event data describing what people and organizations are actually doing. Recent developments in process mining make it possible to analyze such event data, thereby focusing on behavior rather than correlations and simplistic performance indicators. For example, event logs can be used to automatically learn end-to-end process models. Next to the automated discovery of the real underlying process, there are process mining techniques to analyze bottlenecks, to uncover hidden inefficiencies, to check compliance, to explain deviations, to predict performance, and to guide users towards "better" processes. Process mining reveals how people really work and often reveals what they would really like to do. Event-based analysis may reveal workarounds and remarkable differences between people and organizations. This keynote paper highlights current research on comparative process mining. One can compare event data with normative process models and see where people deviate. Some of these deviations may be positive and one can learn from them. Other deviations may reveal inefficiencies, design flaws, or even fraudulent behavior. One can also use process cubes to compare different systems or groups of people. Through slicing, dicing, rolling-up, and drilling-down we can view event data from different angles and produce process mining results that can be compared.

Resolving such errors early can prevent rework or the building of a system that is non-compliant with the client's intention. In developing complex systems and highly interactive systems, such as agent oriented systems, those errors in requirement analysis are even more likely. By focussing on the quality of interactions between the future users of the system and the human modellers, this article presents an innovative validation and verification process to support analysis of requirement analysis. We use domain knowledge to validate compliance with the client's intention. Using layered abstractions, we formulate the validation process which is methodology independent. An interactive support tool is implemented to support the developers using the requirement analysis process. The process is conducted iteratively to accommodate the lifecycle defined by most methodologies. The process and the tool are validated and illustrated using two different development exemplars illustrating different domains and different development methodologies.

However, building a simulation model of a manufacturing system is a difficult task and needs great resource expenditures. Automated data collection and model buildup can drastically reduce the time of the design phase as well as support model reusability. Since most of the manufacturing systems are controlled by low level controllers (e. g., PLCs, CNCs) they inherently store structure and control logic of the system to be modeled by a DES system. The paper introduces an ongoing research of PLC code processing method for automatic ISA standard simulation model generation of a conveyor system of a leading automotive factory. Results of the validation process and simulation experiments are also described through a case study. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B. V.

Such testing methods often lead to bug scenarios revealed as simulation traces which serve as the basis for patching the RTL code in order to fix a possible bug. However, the bug fix can be local in nature in the sense that the bug may possibly manifest itself in an alternate execution trace. The present work leverages AI planning to develop techniques for automatic construction of test programs for sensitizing deep architectural bugs by reproducing a bug scenario as different possible sequences of micro-architectural events given that the scenario was initially observed as one such sequence in a simulation trace. Automated generation of such test programs 1) help to evaluate the robustness of a given bug fix or alternatively 2) identify the root cause of the bug so that a proper fix can be carefully planned.

A (symbolic) path is given as a finite sequence of assignments and assertions (i.e. without loops), and checking its feasibility amounts to determining the existence of inputs that yield a successful execution. Modern programming languages (e.g. JavaScript, PHP, and Python) support many complex string operations, and strings are also often implicitly modified during a computation in some intricate fashion (e.g. by some autoescaping mechanisms). In this paper we provide two general semantic conditions which together ensure the decidability of path feasibility: (1) each assertion admits regular monadic decomposition (i.e. is an effectively recognisable relation), and (2) each assignment uses a (possibly nondeterministic) function whose inverse relation preserves regularity. We show that the semantic conditions are expressive since they are satisfied by a multitude of string operations including concatenation, one-way and two-way finite-state transducers, replaceAll functions (where the replacement string could contain variables), string-reverse functions, regular-expression matching, and some (restricted) forms of letter-counting/length functions. The semantic conditions also strictly subsume existing decidable string theories (e.g. straight-line fragments, and acyclic logics), and most existing benchmarks (e.g. most of Kaluza's, and all of SLOG's, Stranger's, and SLOTH's benchmarks). Our semantic conditions also yield a conceptually simple decision procedure, as well as an extensible architecture of a string solver in that a user may easily incorporate his/her own string functions into the solver by simply providing code for the pre-image computation without worrying about other parts of the solver. Despite these, the semantic conditions are unfortunately too general to provide a fast and complete decision procedure. We provide strong theoretical evidence for this in the form of complexity results. To rectify this problem, we propose two solutions. Our main solution is to allow only partial string functions (i.e., prohibit nondeterminism) in condition (2). This restriction is satisfied in many cases in practice, and yields decision procedures that are effective in both theory and practice. Whenever nondeterministic functions are still needed (e.g. the string function split), our second solution is to provide a syntactic fragment that provides a support of nondeterministic functions, and operations like one-way transducers, replaceAll (with constant replacement string), the string-reverse function, concatenation, and regular-expression matching. We show that this fragment can be reduced to an existing solver SLOTH that exploits fast model checking algorithms like IC3. We provide an efficient implementation of our decision procedure (assuming our first solution above, i.e., deterministic partial string functions) in a new string solver OSTRICH. Our implementation provides built-in support for concatenation, reverse, functional transducers (FFT), and replace All and provides a framework for extensibility to support further string functions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our new solver against other competitive solvers.

Objective: The goal of this research work is to provide a full round-trip engineering approach in order to evaluate quality attributes of the embedded system by code execution monitoring as well as code static analysis and then provide back-propagation of the resulting values to modelling level. In this way, properties that can only be roughly estimated statically are evaluated against observed values and this consequently allows to refine the design models for ensuring preservation of analysed extra-functional properties at code level. Method: Following the model-driven engineering vision, (meta-) models and transformations are used as main artefacts for the realisation of the round-trip support which is finally validated against an industrial case study. Result: This article presents an approach to support the whole round-trip process starting from the generation of source code for a target platform, passing through the monitoring of selected system quality attributes at code level, and finishing with the back-propagation of observed values to modelling level. The technique is validated against an industrial case study in the telecommunications applicative domain. Conclusion: Preservation of extra-functional properties through appropriate description, computation and evaluation makes it possible to reduce final product verification and validation effort and costs by generating correct-by-construction code. The proposed round-trip support aids a model-driven component-based development process in ensuring a desired level of extra-functional properties preservation from the source modelling artefacts to the generated code.

The main goal is the formalisation of behaviours, described with UML sequence diagram, to make verification activity by space state exploration and to make validation activity of a set of traces by simulation. In this context, we have chosen to elaborate a model transformation. This paper shows how, after the construction of meta-model for sequence diagrams and for Finite and Deterministic DEVS, it is possible to automate the transformation from one instance of source meta-model to one instance of destination meta-model. The source model is a sequence diagram and the target model is a FD-DEVS component. The destination model is converted into DEVSJava code to simulate its execution.

Wheel loaders need the ability to identify different objects and other equipment to perform the task of automatically loading and dumping material on dump trucks, which can be achieved using deep neural networks. Training such networks from scratch requires the iterative collection of potentially large amounts of video data, which is challenging at construction sites because of the complexity of safely operating heavy equipment in realistic environments. Transfer learning, for which pretrained neural networks can be retrained for use at construction sites, is thus attractive, especially if data can be acquired without full-scale experiments. We investigate the possibility of using scale-model data for training and validating two different pretrained networks and use real-world test data to examine their generalization capability. A dataset containing 268 images of a 1:16 scale model of a Volvo A60H dump truck is provided, as well as 64 test images of a full-size Volvo A25G dump truck. The code and dataset are publicly available1. The networks, both pretrained on the MS-COCO dataset, were fine-tuned to the created dataset, and the results indicate that both networks can learn the features of the scale-model dump truck (validation mAP of 0.82 for YOLOv3 and 0.95 for RetinaNet). Both networks can transfer these learned features to detect objects on a full-size dump truck with no additional training (test mAP of 0.70 for YOLOv3 and 0.79 for RetinaNet).

This is especially true in a Continuous Test Generation (CTG) environment, where the automatic generation of test cases is integrated into the continuous integration pipeline. In this context, developers want to achieve a certain minimum level of coverage for every software build. However, executing all the test cases and, moreover, generating new ones for all the classes at every commit is not feasible. As a consequence, developers have to select which subset of classes has to be tested and/or targeted by test-case generation. We argue that knowing a priori the branch coverage that can be achieved with test-data generation tools can help developers into taking informed decision about those issues. In this paper, we investigate the possibility to use source-code metrics to predict the coverage achieved by test-data generation tools. We use four different categories of source-code features and assess the prediction on a large data set involving more than 3'000 Java classes. We compare different machine learning algorithms and conduct a fine-grained feature analysis aimed at investigating the factors that most impact the prediction accuracy. Moreover, we extend our investigation to four different search budgets. Our evaluation shows that the best model achieves an average 0.15 and 0.21 MAE on nested cross-validation over the different budgets, respectively, on EVOSUITE and RANDOOP. Finally, the discussion of the results demonstrate the relevance of coupling-related features for the prediction accuracy.

The study is essential for automating and performing subsequent statistical analysis of the process, so the logical, structural and functional models of the process have been obtained and studied. In the study, the authors used the deductive system (developed by them) of the process of choosing the best alternative. First of all, the network modelling method was applied, alongside with the graphic way of calculation and formulae for defining the early and late event occurrence term. It has been found that the optimal time implies one cognitive work on selecting the best alternative from many known ones proceeding from a certain volume of knowledge, which needs automating. Next, Kolmogorov equations for the choice process were generated, with data obtained and a graph built which allowed making some useful conclusions. Having only a half of the amount of knowledge in a subject area enables one to get a simple intelligent system repeating the critical path 1-2-3-4-5. A smaller volume of knowledge can be used for a learning intelligent system, and a greater volume - in an intelligent system featuring error correction and check for compliance with the expected result. Then, an intelligent system conducting exploratory research has to possess the total volume of knowledge in order to maximize its cognitive power up to lambda = 1, in which case the efficiency of this system will be comparable to that of the natural intelligence. This is why the authors looked for an approach which would be close to the natural intelligence in representing metaknowledge. The paper provides a specific representation of metaknowledge, with the decision tree being that of a multitude of precedents. All the rules are applied for obtaining the tree, in which a consequent is a corresponding antecedent, and the transition to it corresponds to the obtained tree structure. Such trees can be used for representing metaknowledge and searching for solutions while organizing the efficient choice process.

Distributed processing, enabled by automated federation, mobile code, intelligent process allocation, dynamic multiprocessing groups, check pointing, and other capabilities creates a virtual peer-to-peer computing network across the force. Reconfigurable networking, consisting of content-based information exchange, dynamic ad-hoc routing, information operations (perception management) and other component technologies forms the interconnect fabric for fault tolerant inter processor and node communication. Distributed resource management. which provides the means for distributed cooperative sensor management, opportunistic collection, symbiotic inductive/deductive reasoning and other applications provides the canonical algorithms for network-centric enterprises and warfare. This paper introduces these three core technologies and briefly discusses a sampling of their component technologies and their individual contributions to network-centric enterprises and warfare. Based on the implied requirements, two new algorithms are defined and characterized which provide critical building blocks for network centricity: distributed asynchronous auctioning and predictive dynamic source routing. The first provides a reliable, efficient, effective approach for near-optimal assignment problems; the algorithm has been demonstrated to be a viable implementation for ad-hoc command and control, object/sensor pairing, and weapon/target assignment. The second is founded on traditional dynamic source routing (from mobile ad-hoc networking), but leverages the results of ad-hoc command and control (from the contributed auctioning algorithm) into significant increases in connection reliability through forward prediction. Emphasis is placed on the advantages gained from the closed-loop interaction of the multiple technologies in the network-centric application environment.

A vulnerability assessment is the process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing (or ranking) the vulnerabilities in a system. A vulnerability assessment is conducted to determine the weaknesses inherent in the information systems that could be exploited, leading to information system breach. In this paper we will discuss different types of SQL injection methods. Besides the manual testing approaches, we will try to explain some automated testing approaches which focuses on improving the accurateness and exactness of vulnerability testing. Moreover in this paper we will discuss the main principles of automated testing approach. As a rule, SQL-injection attacks depend on some weak validation of text based input data which are put to use for building database queries. Malignantly crafted input may debilitate the confidentiality and the security strategies of sites depending on the database to store and recover data. This paper introduces a unique methodology in light of static investigation to consequently recognize statements in PHP applications that may be defenseless to SQL-injection activated by either vindictive input or vindictive code.

EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AUTOMATED OMA FOR STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING OF EXISTING BRIDGES IN SEISMIC AREAS	7TH IOMAC: INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONAL MODAL ANALYSIS CONFERENCE	Messtechnik und Sensorik		English	Proceedings Paper	7th International Operational Modal Analysis Conference	MAY 09-12, 2017	Ingolstadt, GERMANY	TH Ingolstadt, Bruel & Kjaer, Structural Vibrat Solut, Polytec, Dynam Design Solut, KOTTER CONSULT ENGINEERS, SIEMENS				Bridges play an important role to ensure the efficiency of the transportation network and prompt rescue in the case of an emergency. However, most of the existing bridges have been designed and built according to outdated codes. Post-earthquake surveys have remarked the significant impact of strong seismic events on the road network. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems can support the prompt assessment of bridges after seismic events. However, this has always been challenging due to the need of analyzing large amount of data. Effective vibration-based damage detection requires accurate modal parameter estimates automatically obtained from the analysis of the operational response of the monitored structure. However, earthquake shaking can also cause saturation of sensors aimed at resolving the ambient vibration response only, thus affecting the reliability of monitoring. The present paper aims at evaluating, against real data, the effectiveness of automated Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) for vibration-based SHM of existing bridges in earthquake prone areas. Shaking table tests have been carried on a 1:3 scale single span bridge representative of existing highway bridges built in the 60's in Italy. The dynamic properties of the structure in operational conditions have been estimated first. Seismic input has been applied afterwards, and the structural response has been analyzed for damage detection. Results show that hidden damage can be identified on a remote basis, thus demonstrating the interesting applicative perspectives of automated OMA for fast health assessment of existing bridges in the early earthquake aftershock. The resilience to earthquake shaking of the SHM system has been also assessed, showing that a reliable modal-based monitoring before and after the earthquake by means of automated OMA is possible even in the presence of a measurement chain not specifically designed to resolve the strong motion response.

The chosen architecture centric approach represents an instance of the Model Driven Architecture. The goal is the furthermost automated and standardized production of software system families for the ScatterWeb ESBs. For this purpose, we developed a component meta model which builds a basis for a complete tool chain, from the model platform all the way to the deployment of the generated code onto the Sensor Boards. To model a ScatterWeb network, we developed a domain specific graphical editor on the basis of the Eclipse Modeling Framework and the Graphical Modeling Framework. For the examination of static model constraints, we integrated a real time validation into the editor. We used the openArchitectureWare framework for the transformation from models into code. The ScatterFactory framework was completed with additional components like flash-components for the automatic deployment of generated artifacts in an existing network. We realized our ScatterFactory tool with the Eclipse Framework as a basis.

Comparative analysis, applications, and interpretation of electronic health record-based stroke phenotyping methods	BIODATA MINING			English	Article						Phenotyping algorithms; Acute ischemic stroke; Machine learning; Electronic health record studies	HEART-DISEASE; BIG DATA; DIAGNOSIS; MODELS; UPDATE; RISK	Background Accurate identification of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patient cohorts is essential for a wide range of clinical investigations. Automated phenotyping methods that leverage electronic health records (EHRs) represent a fundamentally new approach cohort identification without current laborious and ungeneralizable generation of phenotyping algorithms. We systematically compared and evaluated the ability of machine learning algorithms and case-control combinations to phenotype acute ischemic stroke patients using data from an EHR. Materials and methods Using structured patient data from the EHR at a tertiary-care hospital system, we built and evaluated machine learning models to identify patients with AIS based on 75 different case-control and classifier combinations. We then estimated the prevalence of AIS patients across the EHR. Finally, we externally validated the ability of the models to detect AIS patients without AIS diagnosis codes using the UK Biobank. Results Across all models, we found that the mean AUROC for detecting AIS was 0.963 +/- 0.0520 and average precision score 0.790 +/- 0.196 with minimal feature processing. Classifiers trained with cases with AIS diagnosis codes and controls with no cerebrovascular disease codes had the best average F1 score (0.832 +/- 0.0383). In the external validation, we found that the top probabilities from a model-predicted AIS cohort were significantly enriched for AIS patients without AIS diagnosis codes (60-150 fold over expected). Conclusions Our findings support machine learning algorithms as a generalizable way to accurately identify AIS patients without using process-intensive manual feature curation. When a set of AIS patients is unavailable, diagnosis codes may be used to train classifier models.

J	Mikroyannidi, E; Stevens, R; Iannone, L; Rector, A				Mikroyannidi, Eleni; Stevens, Robert; Iannone, Luigi; Rector, Alan			Analysing Syntactic Regularities and Irregularities in SNOMED-CT	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL SEMANTICS			English	Article							LOGIC	Motivation: In this paper we demonstrate the usage of RIO; a framework for detecting syntactic regularities using cluster analysis of the entities in the signature of an ontology. Quality assurance in ontologies is vital for their use in real applications, as well as a complex and difficult task. It is also important to have such methods and tools when the ontology lacks documentation and the user cannot consult the ontology developers to understand its construction. One aspect of quality assurance is checking how well an ontology complies with established 'coding standards'; is the ontology regular in how descriptions of different types of entities are axiomatised? Is there a similar way to describe them and are there any corner cases that are not covered by a pattern? Detection of regularities and irregularities in axiom patterns should provide ontology authors and quality inspectors with a level of abstraction such that compliance to coding standards can be automated. However, there is a lack of such reverse ontology engineering methods and tools. Results: RIO framework allows regularities to be detected in an OWL ontology, i.e. repetitive structures in the axioms of an ontology. We describe the use of standard machine learning approaches to make clusters of similar entities and generalise over their axioms to find regularities. This abstraction allows matches to, and deviations from, an ontology's patterns to be shown. We demonstrate its usage with the inspection of three modules from SNOMED-CT, a large medical terminology, that cover "Present" and "Absent" findings, as well as "Chronic" and "Acute" findings. The module sizes are 5 065, 20 688 and 19 812 asserted axioms. They are analysed in terms of their types and number of regularities and irregularities in the asserted axioms of the ontology. The analysis showed that some modules of the terminology, which were expected to instantiate a pattern described in the SNOMED-CT technical guide, were found to have a high number of regularity deviations. A subset of these were categorised as "design defects" by verifying them with past work on the quality assurance of SNOMED-CT. These were mainly incomplete descriptions. In the worst case, the expected patterns described in the technical guide were followed by only 5% of the axioms in the module. Conclusion: It is possible to automatically detect regularities and then inspect irregularities in an ontology. We argue that RIO is a tool to find and report such matches and mismatches, for evaluations by the domain experts. We have demonstrated that standard clustering techniques from machine learning can offer a tool in the drive for quality assurance in ontologies.

J	Cortellessa, V; Pierini, P; Rossi, D				Cortellessa, Vittorio; Pierini, Pierluigi; Rossi, Daniele			Integrating software models and platform models for performance analysis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Article						software performance; software model; platform model; UML; simulation		System performance is a key factor to take into account throughout the software life cycle of modern computer systems, mostly due to their typical characteristics such as distributed deployment, code mobility, and platform heterogeneity. An open challenge in this direction is to integrate the performance validation as a transparent and efficient activity in the system development process. Several methodologies have been proposed to automate the transformation of software/ hardware models into performance models. In this paper, we do not take a transformational approach; rather, we present a framework to integrate a software model with a platform model in order to build a performance model. Performance indices are obtained from simulation of the resulting performance model. Our framework provides a library of predefined resource models, model annotation and integration procedures, and simulation support that makes the performance analysis a much easier activity. We present the results obtained from two different industrial case studies that show the maturity and the stability of our approach.

Model Based Testing of Satellite On-Board Software - an Industrial Use Case	2016 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE	IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Aerospace Conference	MAR 05-12, 2016	Big Sky, MT	IEEE				In this paper we describe a Model Based approach to testing of on-board software and compare it with traditional validation strategy currently applied to satellite software. The major problems that software engineering will face over at least the next two decades are increasing application complexity driven by the need for autonomy and serious application robustness. In other words, how do we actually get to declare success when trying to build applications one or two orders of magnitude more complex than today's applications. To solve the problems addressed above the software engineering process has to be improved at least for two aspects: 1) Software design and 2) Software testing. The software design process has to evolve towards model-based approaches with extensive use of code generators. Today, testing is an essential, but time and resource consuming activity in the software development process. Generating a short, but effective test suite usually requires a lot of manual work and expert knowledge. In a model-based process, among other subtasks, test construction and test execution can also be partially automated. The basic idea behind the presented study was to start from a formal model (e.g. State Machines), generate abstract test cases which are then converted to concrete executable test cases (input and expected output pairs). The generated concrete test cases were applied to an on-board software. Results were collected and evaluated wrt. applicability, cost-efficiency, effectiveness at fault finding, and scalability.

In principle, models can be used in the product engineering lifecycle in an end-to-end manner for representing requirements, designs and implementations, and assisting in deployment and maintenance. The manipulations applied to models may be manual, but they can also be automated-for example, using model transformations, code generation, and validation. To enhance automated analysis, consistency and coherence of models used in an MDE process, it is useful to identify, establish and maintain trace-links between models. However, the breadth and scope of trace-links that can be used in MDE is substantial, and managing trace-link information can be very complex. In this paper, we contribute to managing the complexity of traceability information in MDE in two ways: firstly, we demonstrate how to identify the different kinds of trace-links that may appear in an end-to-end MDE process; secondly, we describe a rigorous approach to defining semantically rich trace-links between models, where the models themselves may be constructed using diverse modelling languages. The definition of rich trace-links allows us to use tools to maintain and analyse traceability relationships.

Modern Nuclear Data Evaluation with the TALYS Code System	NUCLEAR DATA SHEETS			English	Article							DATA UNCERTAINTY PROPAGATION; ELASTIC DEUTERON SCATTERING; UNIFIED MONTE-CARLO; OPTICAL-MODEL; PROTON-SCATTERING; PRECOMPOUND-DECAY; ENERGY-DEPENDENCE; EXCITON MODEL; NEUTRON-RICH; ISOTOPES	This paper presents a general overview of nuclear data evaluation and its applications as developed at NRG, Petten. Based on concepts such as robustness; reproducibility and automation, modern calculation tools are exploited to produce original nuclear data libraries that meet the current demands on quality and completeness. This requires a system which comprises differential measurements, theory development, nuclear model codes, resonance analysis, evaluation, ENDF formatting, data processing and integral validation in one integrated approach. Software, built around the TALYS code, will be presented in which all these essential nuclear data components are seamlessly integrated. Besides the quality of the basic data and its extensive format testing, a second goal lies in the diversity of processing for different type of users. The implications of this scheme are unprecedented. The most important are: 1. Complete ENDF-6 nuclear data files, in the form of the TENDL library, including covariance matrices, for many isotopes, particles, energies, reaction channels and derived quantities. All isotopic data files are mutually consistent and are supposed to rival those of the major world libraries. 2. More exact uncertainty propagation from basic nuclear physics to applied (reactor) calculations based on a Monte Carlo approach: "Total" Monte Carlo (TMC), using random nuclear data libraries. 3. Automatic optimization in the form of systematic feedback from integral measurements back to the basic data. This method of work also opens a new way of approaching the analysis of nuclear applications, with consequences in both applied nuclear physics and safety of nuclear installations, and several examples are given here. This applied experience and feedback is integrated in a final step to improve the quality of the nuclear data, to change the users vision and finally to orchestrate their integration into simulation codes.

Design and Development of a Rehabilitative Eye-Tracking Based Home Automation System	2016 3RD MIDDLE EAST CONFERENCE ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING (MECBME)	Middle East Conference on Biomedical Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	3rd Middle East Conference on Biomedical Engineering (MECBME)	OCT 06-07, 2016	Beirut, LEBANON			Locked-in Syndrome; Eye Tracking; Home Automation		Locked-in syndrome is known to be a condition in which a patient loses the ability to control nearly all voluntary muscles in the body except for the eye. In today's world, healthcare facilities have the means and equipment necessary to help such patients and take care of their needs, which includes medical care and patient comfort. However, such dedicated professional services are not commonly provided at the patient's dwelling, and more can still be done when it comes to patient's comfort and self-reliance. This paper delineates the design and development of an eye-tracking based home automation system that provides the targeted locked-in patient with the ability to control appliances using his/her eyes. In the developed system, eye movement, pupil position, size, and velocity are determined using a built-in laptop camera in conjunction with a series of algorithms coded in MATLAB (R). The camera is adjusted in such a way so as to be leveled horizontally with the eye-sight of the patient. Further algorithms are to allow the user to control and move the mouse cursor with his/her eye movements. A specially designed graphical user interface provides the individual with the options as to what he/she wishes to control. An Arduino microcontroller differentiates the received instructions from the user and provides an output to the intended device. The controlled appliances within the patient's habitat are doors, window shutters, lightings, bed control, television set, and heating ventilation and air-conditioning. Further modular improvement of this system could be introduced as need arises. The system was validated using a series of tests on normal control individuals. The validation results show high accuracy and precision. The significance of this system lies in helping locked-in patients gain control over some aspects of their lives; accordingly, they will no longer require continuous assistance to secure their comfort but rather be self-reliant.

J	Le, TDB; Thung, F; Lo, D				Le, Tien-Duy B.; Thung, Ferdian; Lo, David			Will this localization tool be effective for this bug? Mitigating the impact of unreliability of information retrieval based bug localization tools	EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Text classification; Information retrieval; Bug reports; Bug localization; Effectiveness prediction	CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHMS; SEVERITY	Information retrieval (IR) based bug localization approaches process a textual bug report and a collection of source code files to find buggy files. They output a ranked list of files sorted by their likelihood to contain the bug. Recently, several IR-based bug localization tools have been proposed. However, there are no perfect tools that can successfully localize faults within a few number of most suspicious program elements for every single input bug report. Therefore, it is difficult for developers to decide which tool would be effective for a given bug report. Furthermore, for some bug reports, no bug localization tools would be useful. Even a state-of-the-art bug localization tool outputs many ranked lists where buggy files appear very low in the lists. This potentially causes developers to distrust bug localization tools. In this work, we build an oracle that can automatically predict whether a ranked list produced by an IR-based bug localization tool is likely to be effective or not. We consider a ranked list to be effective if a buggy file appears in the top-N position of the list. If a ranked list is unlikely to be effective, developers do not need to waste time in checking the recommended files one by one. In such cases, it is better for developers to use traditional debugging methods or request for further information to localize bugs. To build this oracle, our approach extracts features that can be divided into four categories: score features, textual features, topic model features, and metadata features. We build a separate prediction model for each category, and combine them to create a composite prediction model which is used as the oracle. We name this solution APRILE, which stands for Automated PRediction of IR-based Bug Localization's Effectiveness. We further integrate APRILE with two other components that are learned using our bagging-based ensemble classification (BEC) method. We refer to the extension of APRILE as APRILE (+). We have evaluated APRILE (+) to predict the effectiveness of three state-of-the-art IR-based bug localization tools on more than three thousands bug reports from AspectJ, Eclipse, SWT, and Tomcat. APRILE (+) can achieve an average precision, recall, and F-measure of 77.61 %, 88.94 %, and 82.09 %, respectively. Furthermore, APRILE (+) outperforms a baseline approach by Le and Lo and APRILE by up to a 17.43 % and 10.51 % increase in F-measure respectively.

C	Dufour, C; Abourida, S; Belanger, J; Lapointe, V			IEEE	Dufour, Christian; Abourida, Simon; Belanger, Jean; Lapointe, Vincent			Real-time simulation of permanent magnet motor drive on FPGA chip for high-bandwidth controller tests and validation	IECON 2006 - 32ND ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, VOLS 1-11	IEEE Industrial Electronics Society		English	Proceedings Paper	32nd Annual Conference of the IEEE-Industrial-Electronics-Society	NOV 07-10, 2006	Paris, FRANCE	IEEE Ind Elect Soc				Presented is a real-time simulator of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive implemented on an FPGA card. Real-time simulation of PMSM drives enable thorough testing of control strategies and rapid deployment of vehicular or industrial applications. The PMSM model is based on Park transform with a reference frame on the rotor and assumes sinusoidal flux induction. A 3-phase IGBT inverter drives the PMSM machine. Both models are implemented with the RT-LAB real-time simulation platform of Opal-RT Technologies using a Simulink blockset called Xilinx System Generator (XSG,), and without any VHDL coding. The paper explains various aspects of the design of the motor drive models in fixed-point representation in XSG, as well as actual simulation validation against a standard PMSM drive model built in Simulink. The PMSM drive, along with a test source for the pulse width modulation, is coded for an FPGA card. The model has user-selectable dead time, modulation index, source angle offset, and frequency. The overall model compilation and simulation is entirely automated by RT-LAB. The drive can also run in a closed loop with a controller executing on a CPU of a real-time simulator. The final PMSM drive model runs with a 20-ns integration time step, allows for time multiplexing of d-q values, and has an I/O latency of 310 ns (250 ns for the PMSM machine alone). The drive is directly connected to RT-LAB digital inputs and analog outputs (1 microsecond settling time) on the FPGA card and has a resulting total hardware-in-the-loop latency of 1.31 microseconds.

This separation seeks to improve human readability. However, it also has a deleterious effect on many Wikipedia-based tasks that rely on the article-as-concept assumption, which requires each entity (or concept) to be described solely by one article. This underlying assumption significantly simplifies knowledge representation and extraction, and it is vital to many existing technologies such as automated knowledge base construction, cross-lingual knowledge alignment, semantic search and data lineage of Wikipedia entities. In this paper we provide an approach to match the scattered sub-articles back to their corresponding main-articles, with the intent of facilitating automated Wikipedia curation and processing. The proposed model adopts a hierarchical learning structure that combines multiple variants of neural document pair encoders with a comprehensive set of explicit features. A large crowdsourced dataset is created to support the evaluation and feature extraction for the task. Based on the large dataset, the proposed model achieves promising results of cross-validation and significantly outperforms previous approaches. Large-scale serving on the entire English Wikipedia also proves the practicability and scalability of the proposed model by effectively extracting a vast collection of newly paired main and sub-articles.

J	Bashari, M; Bagheri, E; Du, WC				Bashari, Mandi; Bagheri, Ebrahim; Du, Weichang			Automated composition and optimization of services for variability-intensive domains	JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Social Robotics (ICSR)	NOV 22-24, 2017	Tsukuba, JAPAN			Feature models; Software product lines; Automated composition; Planning; Workflow optimization; BPEL	PROCESS MODELS; WEB SERVICES; VALIDATION; SYSTEM	The growth in the number of publicly available services on the Web has encouraged developers to rely more heavily on such services to deliver products in a faster, cheaper and more reliable fashion. Many developers are now using a collection of these services in tandem to build their applications. While there has been much attention to the area of service composition, there are few works that examine the possibility of automatically generating service compositions for variability-intensive application domains. High variability in a domain is often captured through an organized feature space, which has the potential for developing many different application instantiations. The focus of our work is to develop an end-to-end technique that would enable the automatic generation of composite services based on a specific configuration of the feature space that would be directly executable and presented in WS-BPEL format. To this end, we adopt concepts from software product line engineering and AI planning to deliver the automated composition of online services. We will further benefit from such notions as safeness and threat from AI planning to optimize the generated service compositions by introducing parallelism where possible. Furthermore, we show how the specification of the generated service composition can be translated into executable WS-BPEL code. More specifically, the core contributions of our work are: (1) we show how AI planning techniques can be used to generate a workflow based on a feature model configuration; (2) we propose a method for optimizing a workflow generated based on Al planning techniques; and (3) we demonstrate that the optimized workflow can be directly translated into WS-BPEL code. We evaluate our work from two perspectives: (i) we will first formally prove that the methods that we have proposed are sound and complete from a theoretical perspective, and (ii) we will show through experimentation that our proposed work is usable from a practical point of view.

These systems nowadays show System of Systems (SoS) characteristics including large-scale, consisting of software and hardware components, and cooperative processes among independent systems. It is very important to validate functional requirements and evaluate non-functional requirements of systems precisely in earlier design phase by executable architecting methodology. This paper aims to provide an executable modeling approach to SOA by bringing together Model Driven Service Engineering (MDSE) with Service oriented architecture Modeling Language (SoaML) and Modeling & Simulation methodology based on Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS). First, the business architecture and system architecture are built with SoaML; then the Extended DEVS Modeling Language (E-DEVSML) is used as a model transformation intermediary to make SOA models executable in an automated code generation process; finally, the early validation and evaluation of this SOA are done through a generated DEVS simulation. To demonstrate the applicability of this approach we introduce an aircraft docking process in an airport scenario as the case study.

We followed clinical acceptance tests required to approve the certified treatment planning system for clinical use. We implemented an automated and efficient procedure to build a parameter library characterizing the clinical proton pencil beam. Beam energy, energy spread, lateral propagation model, and a dosimetric calibration factor were parametrized based on measurements performed during the facility start-up. The FRED beam model was validated against commissioning and supplementary measurements performed with and without range shifter. We obtained 1) submillimeter agreement of Bragg peak shapes in water and lateral beam profiles in air and slab phantoms, 2) < 2% dose agreement for spread out Bragg peaks of different ranges, 3) average gamma index (2%/2 mm) passing rate of > 95% for > 1000 patient verification measurements using a two-dimensional array of ionization chambers, and 4) gamma index passing rate of > 99% for three-dimensional dose distributions computed with FRED and measured with an array of ionization chambers behind an anthropomorphic phantom. The results of example treatment planning study on > 100 patients demonstrated that FRED simulations in computed tomography enable an accurate prediction of dose distribution in patient and application of FRED as second patient quality assurance tool. Computation of a patient treatment in a CT using 104 protons per pencil beam took on average 2'30 min with a tracking rate of 2.9x10(5) p(+)/s. FRED was successfully commissioned and validated against the clinical beam model, showing that it could potentially be used in clinical routine. Thanks to high computational performance due to GPU acceleration and an automated beam model implementation method, the application of FRED is now possible for research or quality assurance purposes in most of the proton facilities.

J	Ahmed, AT				Ahmed, Abdelkader T.			Experimental and numerical study for seawater intrusion remediation in heterogeneous coastal aquifer	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Seawater intrusion; Remediation; Automated experimental measurements; Numerical modelling		The contamination of fresh groundwater by saltwater intrusion (SWI) becomes a worldwide alarming problem, which threatens all countries depending on groundwater abstraction from coastal areas. Various control and treatment strategies have been suggested to prevent SWI. The construction of subsurface physical barriers is one of the most practical implementation methods to prevent SWI. In this work, the use of subsurface dam as a remediation and protection tool was investigated in a heterogeneous aquifer via lab scale experiments and numerical simulation. The experiments depended on a novel automated imaged analysis method for SWI measurements. Glass beads of different grain sizes were used in sandbox experiments. The simulation works adopted the SEAWAT code for validation of the experimental results and making numerical sensitivity analyses for affecting parameters. Results proved the significant impact of using sub water dams with heterogonous aquifers. The remediation impacts of the dam was captured clearly in preventing and backwashing of the existed SWI. The results revealed also that the heterogeneous aquifers with high permeability in the bottom boundary behave closer to the homogenous aquifers in SWI than those having low hydraulic conductivity in the bottom. Sensitivity analyses results showed that the closer dam to seawater boundary led to the quicker and more effective backwashing process. Results exhibited also that the dam height with 50% of the aquifer dam has the ability to hold the seawater so long as the hydraulic gradient is high and dams with 67% of aquifer height prevent the saltwater intrusion completely.

J	Nagrath, V; Schlegel, C				Nagrath, Vineet; Schlegel, Christian			SmartTS: A Component-based and Model-Driven Approach to Software Testing in Robotic Software Ecosystem	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Model-Driven Engineering (MDE); Component-based Software Engineering (CBSE); Model-Driven Testing (MDT); Component-based Software Testing (CBST); Service Robotics; Soft-ware Quality; Automated Software Testing	SYSTEMS	Validating the behaviour of commercial off-the-shelf components and of interactions between them is a complex, and often a manual task. Treated like any other software product, a software component for a robot system is often tested only by the component developer. Test sets and results are often not available to the system builder, who may need to verify functional and non-functional claims made by the component. Availability of test records is key in establishing compliance and thus selection of the most suitable components for system composition. To provide empirically verifiable test records consistent with a component's claims would greatly improve the overall safety and dependability of robotic software systems in open-ended environments. Additionally, a test and validation suite for a system built from the model package of that system empirically codifies its behavioural claims. In this paper, we present the "SmartTS methodology": A component-based and model-driven approach to generate model-bound test-suites for software components and systems. SmartTS methodology and tooling are not restricted to the robotics domain. The core contribution of SmartTS is support for test and validation suites derived from the model packages of components and systems. The test-suites in SmartTS are tightly bound to an application domain's data and service models as defined in the RobMoSys (EU H2020 project) compliant SmartMDSD toolchain. SmartTS does not break component encapsulation for system builders while providing them complete access to the way that component is tested and simulated.

J	Kanan, T; Fox, EA				Kanan, Tarek; Fox, Edward A.			Automated Arabic Text Classification With P-Stemmer, Machine Learning, and a Tailored News Article Taxonomy	JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								Arabic news articles in electronic collections are difficult to study. Browsing by category is rarely supported. Although helpful machine-learning methods have been applied successfully to similar situations for English news articles, limited research has been completed to yield suitable solutions for Arabic news. In connection with a Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF)-funded project to build digital library community and infrastructure in Qatar, we developed software for browsing a collection of about 237,000 Arabic news articles, which should be applicable to other Arabic news collections. We designed a simple taxonomy for Arabic news stories that is suitable for the needs of Qatar and other nations, is compatible with the subject codes of the International Press Telecommunications Council, and was enhanced with the aid of a librarian expert as well as five Arabic-speaking volunteers. We developed tailored stemming (i.e., a new Arabic light stemmer called P-Stemmer) and automatic classification methods (the best being binary Support Vector Machines classifiers) to work with the taxonomy. Using evaluation techniques commonly used in the information retrieval community, including 10-fold cross-validation and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, we showed that our approach to stemming and classification is superior to state-of-the-art techniques.

Current machine learning-based methods used for the automated GO-CC annotation of proteins suffer from the inconsistency of individual GO-CC term predictions. Here, we present FGGA-CC+, a class of hierarchical graph-based classifiers for the consistent GO-CC annotation of protein coding genes at the subcellular compartment or macromolecular complex levels. Aiming to boost the accuracy of GO-CC predictions, we make use of the protein localization knowledge in the GO-Biological Process (GO-BP) annotations to boost the accuracy of GO-CC prediction. As a result, FGGA-CC+ classifiers are built from annotation data in both the GO-CC and GO-BP ontologies. Due to their graph-based design, FGGA-CC+ classifiers are fully interpretable and their predictions amenable to expert analysis. Promising results on protein annotation data from five model organisms were obtained. Additionally, successful validation results in the annotation of a challenging subset of tandem duplicated genes in the tomato non-model organism were accomplished. Overall, these results suggest that FGGA-CC+ classifiers can indeed be useful for satisfying the huge demand of GO-CC annotation arising from ubiquitous high throughout sequencing and proteomic projects.

Leveraging Cheminformatics Strategies for Inorganic Discovery: Application to Redox Potential Design	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							DENSITY-FUNCTIONAL THEORY; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE PREDICTION; TRANSITION-METAL-COMPLEXES; CLEAN ENERGY PROJECT; EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM; ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS; FORCE-FIELD; MOLECULAR SIMILARITY; QUANTUM-CHEMISTRY; CROSS-VALIDATION	Virtual high throughput screening, typically driven by first-principles, density functional theory calculations, has emerged as a powerful tool for the discovery of new. materials. Although the computational materials science community has benefited from open source tools for the rapid structure generation, calculation, and analysis of crystalline inorganic materials, software and strategies to address the unique challenges of inorganic complex discovery have not been as widely available. We present a unified-view of our recent developments in the open source molSimplify code for inorganic discovery. Building on our previous efforts in the automated generation of highly accurate inorganic molecular structures, first-principles simulation, and property analysis to accelerate high-throughput screening, we have recently incorporated a neural network that both improves structure generation and predicts electronic properties prior to first principles calculation. We also provide an overview of how multimillion molecule organic libraries can be leveraged for inorganic discovery alongside cheminformatics concepts of molecular diversity in order to efficiently traverse chemical space. We demonstrate all of these tools on the discovery of design rules for octahedral Fe(II/III) redox couples with nitrogen ligands. Over a search of only approximately 40 new molecules, we obtain redox potentials relative to the Fc/Fc(+) couple ranging from -1 to 4.5 V in aqueous solution. Our new automated correlation analysis reveals heteroatom identity and the degree of structural branching to be key ligand descriptors in determining redox potential. This inorganic discovery toolkit provides a promising approach to advancing transition metal complex design.	[Janet, Jon Paul; Gani, Terry Z.

J	Dufour, C; Belanger, J; Lapointe, V				Dufour, Christian; Belanger, Jean; Lapointe, Vincent			FPGA-based ultra-low latency HIL fault testing of a permanent magnet motor drive using RT-LAB-XSG	SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Symposium on Performance Evaluation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems	JUL 16-18, 2007	San Diego, CA			hardware-in-the-loop; PMSM simulation; FPGA; real-time simulation		Presented is a real-time simulator of a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive implemented on an FPGA card. Real-time simulation of PMSM drives enables thorough testing of control strategies and software protection routines and therefore allows rapid deployment of vehicular or industrial applications. The proposed PMSM model is a phase domain model with sinusoidal flux induction. A 3-phase IGBT inverter drives the PMSM machine. Both models are implemented on an FPGA chip, without any VHDL coding, with the RT-LAB real-time simulation platform of Opal-RT Technologies using a Simulink blockset called Xilinx System Generator (XSG). The paper explains various aspects of the design of the motor drive models in fixed-point representation in XSG, as well as simulation validation against a standard PMSM drive model built in Simulink. The PMSM drive, along with a open-loop test source for the pulse width modulation, is coded for an FPGA card. The model has user-selectable dead time, modulation index, source angle offset, and frequency. The PMSM drive is completed with various encoder models (quadrature, Hall effects and resolver). The overall model compilation and simulation is entirely automated by RT-LAB. The drive can also run in a closed loop with a controller executing on a CPU of a real-time simulator. The phase-domain PMSM drive model runs with an equivalent 10 nanosecond time step (100 MHz FPGA card) and has a latency of 300 nanoseconds (PMSM machine and inverter). The motor drive is directly connected to digital inputs and analog outputs with 1 microsecond settling time on the FPGA card and has a resulting total hardware-in-the-loop latency of 1.3 microseconds.

J	Dimopoulos, AC; Pavlatos, C; Papakonstantinou, G				Dimopoulos, Alexandros C.; Pavlatos, Christos; Papakonstantinou, George			A platform for the automatic generation of attribute evaluation hardware systems	COMPUTER LANGUAGES SYSTEMS & STRUCTURES			English	Article						Attribute grammars; FPGA; Attribute evaluation; Hardware; Semantic evaluation	PARALLEL RECOGNITION; ALGORITHM; GRAMMAR	Attribute grammars (AG) allow the addition of context-sensitive properties into context free grammars, augmenting their expressional capabilities by using syntactic and semantic notations, making them in this way a really useful tool for a considerable number of applications. AGs have extensively been utilized in applications such as artificial intelligence, structural pattern recognition, compiler construction and even text editing. Obviously, the performance of an attribute evaluation system resides in the efficiency of the syntactic and semantic subsystems. In this paper, a hardware architecture for an attribute evaluation system is presented, which is based on an efficient combinatorial implementation of Earley's parallel parsing algorithm for the syntax part of the attribute grammar. The semantic part is managed by a special purpose module that traverses the parse tree and evaluates the attributes based on a proposed stack-based approach. The entire system is described in Verilog HDL (hardware design language), in a template form that given the specification of an arbitrary attribute grammar, the HDL synthesizable source code of the system is produced on the fly by a proposed automated tool. The generated code has been simulated for validation, synthesized and tested on an Xilinx FPGA (field programmable gate arrays) board for various AGs. Our method increases the performance up to three orders of magnitude compared to previous approaches, depending on the implementation, the size of the grammar and the input string length. This makes it particularly appealing for applications where attribute evaluation is a crucial aspect, like in real-time and embedded systems. Specifically, a natural language interface is presented, based on a question-answering application from the area of airline flights. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For the recognition and classification of sewer defects, a significant number of videos and images of sewers are collected. These data are then checked by human and some traditional methods to recognize and classify the sewer defects, which is inefficient and error-prone. Previously developed features like SIFT are unable to comprehensively represent such defects. Therefore, feature representation is especially important for defect autoclassification. In this paper, we study the automatic extraction of feature representation for sewer defects via deep learning. Moreover, a complete automatic system for classifying sewer defects is proposed built on a two-level hierarchical deep convolutional neural network, which shows high performance with respect to classification accuracy. The proposed network is trained on a novel data set with over 40 000 sewer images. The system has been successfully applied in the practical production, confirming its robustness and feasibility to real-world applications. The source code and trained model are available at the project website.(1) Note to Practitioners-Automatic defect inspection has become a fundamental research topic in engineering application field. Specifically, sewer defect detection is an important measure for maintenance, renewal, and rehabilitation activities of sewer infrastructure. In the current operation procedure, all the captured videos need to be inspected by experts frame by frame to recognize defects, yielding a significant low inspection rate with a significant amount of time. Previous work has attempted to employ traditional image processing methods for automated sewer defect classification. However, these methods get poor generalization capabilities since they use pre-engineered features. In most cases, sewerage inspection companies have to hire numerous professional inspectors to do this job, thereby consuming a lot of human and material resources. To address this problem, the authors propose an automatic detection and classification method for sewer defects based on hierarchical deep learning. Demonstrated by various experiments, the designed framework achieves a high defect classification accuracy, which can be easily integrated into an automatic sewer defect inspection system.

J	Chandrakumar, T; Parthasarathy, S				Chandrakumar, Thangavel; Parthasarathy, Sudhaman			An approach to estimate the size of ERP package using package points	COMPUTER STANDARDS & INTERFACES			English	Article						Customization; ERP projects; Efforts; Function points; Package points	COST ESTIMATION; EFFORT PREDICTION; MODEL-DRIVEN; SOFTWARE; REQUIREMENTS; CUSTOMIZATION; VALIDATION; KNOWLEDGE; PROJECTS; SCIENCE	Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) packages are information systems that automate the business processes of organizations thereby improving their operational efficiency substantially. ERP projects that involve customization are often affected by inaccurate estimation of efforts. Size of the software forms the basis for effort estimation. Methods used for effort estimation either employ function points (FP) or lines of code (LOC) to measure the size of customized ERP packages. Literature review reveals that the existing software size methods which are meant for custom-built software products may not be suitable for COTS products such as customized ERP packages. Hence, the effort estimation using conventional methods for customized ERP packages may not be accurate. This paper proposes a new approach to estimate the size of customized ERP packages using Package Points (PP). The proposed approach was validated with data collected from 14 ERP projects delivered by the same company. A positive correlation was observed between Package Points (PP) and the efforts of these projects. This result indicates the feasibility of our proposed approach as well as the positive climate for its utility by the project managers of future ERP projects. Lastly, we examine the implication of these results for practice and future research scope. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Sedrakyan, G; Poelmans, S; Snoeck, M				Sedrakyan, Gayane; Poelmans, Stephan; Snoeck, Monique			Assessing the influence of feedback-inclusive rapid prototyping on understanding the semantics of parallel UML statecharts by novice modellers	INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Conceptual modelling; Statechart; Model pragmatics; Prototyping/simulation; Automated feedback; Testability of requirements	TECHNOLOGY; SIMULATION; QUALITY	Context: UML diagrams are the de facto standard for analysing, communicating and designing software systems, as well as automated code generation. However there is a certain degree of difficulty in understanding a system represented by means of UML diagrams. Object: Our previous research demonstrates a significant improvement in understanding the structural aspects of a system represented as a UML class diagram when using a feedback-inclusive prototype of a model. This paper extends our previous work with an empirical validation study for the effectiveness of the feedback-inclusive rapid prototyping (FIRP) method, on the comprehension of system dynamics represented as multiple interacting UML statecharts. Because models often combine structural and behavioural views that are highly intertwined, we additionally evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to comprehension of the between-view consistency. Method: The FIRP environment was built following the principles of Design Science Research in Information Systems. This study targets the empirical validation of the effectiveness of the proposed technique using an experimental study method. Two experiments were conducted with the participation of 65 final-year master students in the context of different modelling courses from different study programs at KU Leuven using two two-group factorial experimental designs. The effectiveness of the FIRP method was measured by comparing students' performance between the cycles with and without the use of the method, using the understandability (comprehension test results) as the dependent variable and the use of FIRP as the independent variable. Effects from unknown variables were neutralized by means of randomized group compositions. The effectiveness of FIRP was additionally assessed with respect to personal characteristics (age, gender, previous knowledge, self-efficacy) and user acceptance (perceived ease of use, perceived utility, preference, satisfaction). Results: The findings reveal a significant positive impact of the use of the prototyping technique on students' comprehension of system dynamics represented as multiple interacting statecharts. Conclusions: The findings provide empirical support for the advantage of the use of FIRP over manual inspection of interacting statecharts. The findings also suggest that the method is suitable for training system's analysis and modelling skills when UML statecharts are involved. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Xia, HY; Lan, Y; Song, SX; Li, HS				Xia, Haiying; Lan, Yang; Song, Shuxiang; Li, Haisheng			A multi-scale segmentation-to-classification network for tiny microaneurysm detection in fundus images	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Diabetic retinopathy; Microaneurysm detection; Microaneurysm segmentation; Deep learning	DIABETIC-RETINOPATHY; VESSEL SEGMENTATION; AUTOMATED DETECTION; RETINAL IMAGES; VALIDATION	Microaneurysms (MAs) are recognized as the earliest indicators of Diabetic retinopathy (DR), which play an important role in DR screening. However, the detection of MAs is full of challenges due to the fact that the MAs are tiny spots in the complex situations. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale segmentation-to-classification model to improve the accuracy of d MAs detection in the complex situations. This proposed model is primarily composed of two stages: (1) the segmentation of MAs and; (2) the classification for MAs. In the segmentation stage, a multi-scale residual network, termed as MSRNet, is designed to explore the necessary information from the MAs with large size variance. In the classification stage, a multi-scale efficient network, named as MS-EfficientNet, is built to discriminate the false MAs from the MA candidates detected by the MSRNet. Furthermore, we reasonably expand the positive patches by adding constrained variances to the MA ground truths. Experiments show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art with an average sensitivity score of 0.715 on the E-ophtha-MA datasets. The further results with other datasets also demonstrate that the proposed model for MAs segmentation is highly effective and robust.

J	Perez-Castillo, R; Weber, B; de Guzman, IGR; Piattini, M; Pinggera, J				Perez-Castillo, Ricardo; Weber, Barbara; Garcia-Rodriguez de Guzman, Ignacio; Piattini, Mario; Pinggera, Jakob			Assessing event correlation in non-process-aware information systems	SOFTWARE AND SYSTEMS MODELING			English	Article						Business process mining; Event correlation; Event model; Case study		Many present-day companies carry out a huge amount of daily operations through the use of their information systems without ever having done their own enterprise modeling. Business process mining is a well-proven solution which is used to discover the underlying business process models that are supported by existing information systems. Business process discovery techniques employ event logs as input, which are recorded by process-aware information systems. However, a wide variety of traditional information systems do not have any in-built mechanisms with which to collect events (representing the execution of business activities). Various mechanisms with which to collect events from non-process-aware information systems have been proposed in order to enable the application of process mining techniques to traditional information systems. Unfortunately, since business processes supported by traditional information systems are implicitly defined, correlating events into the appropriate process instance is not trivial. This challenge is known as the event correlation problem. This paper presents an adaptation of an existing event correlation algorithm and incorporates it into a technique in order to collect event logs from the execution of traditional information systems. The technique first instruments the source code to collect events together with some candidate correlation attributes. Based on several well-known design patterns, the technique provides a set of guidelines to support experts when instrumenting the source code. The event correlation algorithm is subsequently applied to the data set of events to discover the best correlation conditions, which are then used to create event logs. The technique has been semi-automated to facilitate its validation through an industrial case study involving a writer management system and a healthcare evaluation system. The study demonstrates that the technique is able to discover an appropriate correlation set and obtain well-formed event logs, thus enabling business process mining techniques to be applied to traditional information systems.

Toward Generalizable Models of I/O Throughput	PROCEEDINGS OF 2020 10TH IEEE/ACM INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON RUNTIME AND OPERATING SYSTEMS FOR SUPERCOMPUTERS (ROSS 2020)			English	Proceedings Paper	10th IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Runtime and Operating Systems for Supercomputers (ROSS)	NOV 09-19, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK	IEEE, ACM, IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE Comp Soc Tech Consortium High Performance Comp, SIGHPC		High-Performance Computing; I/O Analysis; Machine Learning; Optimization		Many modern HPC applications do not make good use of the limited available I/O bandwidth. Developing an understanding of the I/O subsystem is a critical first step in order to better utilize an HPC system. While expert insight is indispensable, I/O experts are in rare supply. We seek to automate this effort by developing and interpreting models of I/O throughput. Such interpretations may be useful to both application developers who can use them to improve their codes and to facility operators who can use them to identify larger problems in an HPC system. The application of machine learning (ML) to HPC system analysis has been shown to be a promising direction. However, the direct application of ML methods to I/O throughput prediction often leads to brittle models with low extrapolative power. In this work, we set out to understand the reasons why common methods underperform on this specific problem domain, and how to build models that better generalize on unseen data. We show that commonly used cross-validation testing yields sets that are too similar, preventing us from detecting overfitting. We propose a method for generating test sets that encourages training-test set separation. Next we explore limits of I/O throughput prediction and show that we can estimate I/O contention noise by observing repeated runs of an application. Then we show that by using our new test sets, we can better discriminate different architectures of ML models in terms of how well they generalize.

Towards ontological foundations for conceptual modeling: The unified foundational ontology (UFO) story	APPLIED ONTOLOGY			English	Article						Ontology; conceptual modeling; OntoUML; UFO; ontology-driven conceptual modeling	EXPLORATION	This paper describes a long-term research program on developing ontological foundations for conceptual modeling. This program, organized around the theoretical background of the foundational ontology UFO (Unified Foundational Ontology), aims at developing theories, methodologies and engineering tools with the goal of advancing conceptual modeling as a theoretically sound discipline but also one that has concrete and measurable practical implications. The paper describes the historical context in which UFO was conceived, briefly discusses its stratified organization, and reports on a number of applications of this foundational ontology over more than a decade. In particular, it discusses the most successful application of UFO, namely, the development of the conceptual modeling language OntoUML. The paper also discusses a number of methodological and computational tools, which have been developed over the years to support the OntoUML community. Examples of these methodological tools include ontological patterns and anti-patterns; examples of these computational tools include automated support for pattern-based model construction, formal model verification, formal model validation via visual simulation, model verbalization, code generation and anti-pattern detection and rectification. In addition, the paper reports on a variety of applications in which the language as well as its associated tools have been employed to engineer models in several institutional contexts and domains. Finally, it reflects on some of these lessons learned by observing how OntoUML has been actually used in practice by its community and on how these have influenced both the evolution of the language as well as the advancement of some of the core ontological notions in UFO.

To improve the hippocampus segmentation performance, a local binary pattern based feature extraction method is developed for machine learning based multi-atlas hippocampus segmentation. Under the framework of multi-atlas image segmentation (MAIS), a set of selected atlases are registered to images to be segmented using a non-linear image registration algorithm. The registered atlases are then used as training data to build linear regression models for segmenting the images based on the image features, referred to as random local binary pattern (RLBP), extracted using a novel image feature extraction method. The RLBP based MAIS algorithm has been validated for segmenting hippocampus based on a data set of 135 T1 MR images which are from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (adni.loni.usc.edu). By using manual segmentation labels produced by experienced tracers as the standard of truth, six segmentation evaluation metrics were used to evaluate the image segmentation results by comparing automatic segmentation results with the manual segmentation labels. We further computed Cohen's d effect size to investigate the sensitivity of each segmenting method in detecting volumetric differences of the hippocampus between different groups of subjects. The evaluation results showed that our method was competitive to state-of-the-art label fusion methods in terms of accuracy. Hippocampal volumetric analysis showed that the proposed RLBP method performed well in detecting the volumetric differences of the hippocampus between groups of Alzheimer's disease patients, mild cognitive impairment subjects, and normal controls. These results have demonstrated that the RLBP based multiatlas image segmentation method could facilitate efficient and accurate extraction of the hippocampus and may help predict Alzheimer's disease.

S. freedoms. Supporting said complex systems such as the MV-22/CV-22 aircraft requires being able to troubleshoot and mitigate complex failure modes in dynamic operational environments. Since an aircraft is comprised of multiple systems designed by specialty sub-vendors and subsequently brought together by an aircraft integrator, diagnostics at the aircraft level are usually "good enough" but not capable of 100% fault isolation to a single component. Today's system components must be highly integrated and are required to communicate via high speed data-bus conduits which require precise synchronization between systems. Failure modes of aircraft are identified via design, analysis and test prior to fielding of the weapon system. However, not all failure modes are typically known at the time of system Initial Operational Capability, but rather are found in the field by maintainers/pilots and then subsequently mitigated with aircraft engineering changes or system replacements. Also, the requirement for increased capabilities can drive the need for new systems to be integrated into an aircraft system that may not have been considered in the initial design and support concept. There is a plethora of maintenance action detail collected by pilots, maintenance officers (MO) and engineers that can and should be used to identify failure mode trends that come to light during the operational phase of an aircraft. New troubleshooting techniques can be developed to address underlying failure modes to increase efficiency of future maintenance actions thus reducing the logistics trail required to support the aircraft. The elements available for analysis are maintenance results input by the MO/pilot, (including free form comments regarding problems and resulting actions), Built-In-Test (BIT) fault codes recorded during a flight, and off-aircraft test equipment (such as Consolidated Automated Support System CASS) historical test results. The Integrated Support Environment (ISE) is collecting the data required to perform analysis of underlying maintenance trends that can be identified using some specialized software data mining tools such as text mining of corrective action and maintainer comments data fields from maintenance results. The findings or knowledge extracted from text mining can be correlated back to fault codes recorded during flight and historical maintenance results to help mitigate issues with broken troubleshooting procedures causing headaches to the our Sailors and Marines in the field. By tagging key phrases from the maintainer's/pilot's remarks, knowledge can be gleaned into how the aircraft fails in vigorous environments. The premise of this research is to first choose an apparent high failure avionics system on the V-22 aircraft that is experiencing a high removal rate from the aircraft but subsequently found to be fully operational when tested on CASS. The results of this analysis should present potential root causes for "Cannot Duplicate" situations by recommending an augmentation of diagnostics at the aircraft level to avoid removing and replacing a system that has not failed even though it has reported bad via the aircraft diagnostics. This research will utilize the Net-Centric Diagnostics Framework (NCDF) to retrieve past Smart Test Program Set (TPS) results/BIT sequence strings as a variable for identifying trends in V-22 aircraft maintenance actions. The results of theresearch will be socialized with the V-22 avionics Fleet Support Team and the Comprehensive Automated Maintenance Environment Optimized (CAMEO) for validation of findings before any troubleshooting changes are recommended. If required, the Integrated Diagnostics and Automated Test Systems group will perform an engineering analysis of problem and suggest an enhanced diagnostic technique to mitigate the issue.

Evaluation of GNSS RF-Signal Simulators and - Receivers based on Recorded Multi GNSS Signals in Scenarios of Traffic Telematics	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 26TH INTERNATIONAL TECHNICAL MEETING OF THE SATELLITE DIVISION OF THE INSTITUTE OF NAVIGATION (ION GNSS 2013)	Institute of Navigation Satellite Division Proceedings of the International Technical Meeting		English	Proceedings Paper	26th International Technical Meeting of The Satellite-Division-of-the-Institute-of-Navigation (ION GNSS)	SEP 16-20, 2013	Nashville, TN	Inst Navigat, Satellite Div				Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) such as GPS or GLONASS form a fundamental basis for the optimization of traffic processes over all modes of transport (road, rail, air and water). Reliable location, navigation and timing information of the operating traffic participants serve as a basis for that. In traffic telematics, algorithms to locate and track vehicles, people and objects play an important role. Both the choice of input data in the form of number and type of data to be fused as well as the functioning of algorithms themselves are of decisive importance. Future system concepts, such as fully automated driving, need the compliance of integrity, continuity and especially positioning requirements of the used traffic ways. For example a necessary lane-selective localization of vehicles on the road or a high-precision positioning in inland navigation during a lockage is meant. From operational point of view, field tests for GNSS measurements in rail traffic and inland navigation are difficult in planning, work-intensive in theirs realization and expensive in theirs implementation. Furthermore validation tests regarding receiver hardware and positioning or tracking algorithms require comparable and repeatable signal conditions. In general, this task represents a challenge for GNSS measurements because satellite geometry, ionospheric conditions and environmental reflections change steadily. A solution for the above problems is the use of a modular GNSS radio frequency (RF) signal simulator for mobile field trials. A RF signal simulator consists of a RF generator unit and a RF recorder unit. On the one hand the generator unit is able to output synthetic protocol-compliant GNSS signals and on the other hand it is able to replay GNSS signals reproducibly, recorded during field tests. Both methods offer advantages and disadvantages. The protocol compliant generation of synthetically generated GNSS signals offers the advantage of knowledge about noise performance and artificially generated disturbances (e.g. multipath propagation). Therefore algorithms for their characterization can be developed, analyzed and assessed specifically to the error sources. The disadvantage in using synthetically generated GNSS signals is that error sources can be only limitedly modeled and integrated. In contrast, recorded real measurement data contains all of the above mentioned error sources, but neither their magnitude and occurrence is completely known, nor the error sources can be divided. In this context, the paper discusses the achievable reproducibility of GNSS signal generators used to record and replay field measurements in traffic telematics environments. In this regard, problem scenarios in the field tests are identified and classified in the second part of the paper. For this purpose, representative scenarios in the European rail environment, concretely in the railway network of the DB RegioNetz Erzgebirgsbahn (Germany) and Matterhorn Gotthard Balm (Switzerland), signals were technically analyzed and archived in a signal library. This signal library contains problematic areas, such as one or two sided shading because of woods, rock faces, buildings of rail infrastructure or driving under bridges, in tunnels and gallery tunnels. Based on the GNSS signals generated by using this signal library, qualitative investigations were carried out in terms of achievable track sensitive accuracies. For that reason, several GNSS receivers of different performance and price levels were used. Furthermore, the paper discusses the search for reasons of errors regarding the reproducibility of the calculated locating solutions. Those errors could be found in the subcomponents RF recorder unit, RF generator unit, GNSS receiver and also in the laboratory test setup. The discussion of statistically evaluated results in accuracy and reproducibility follows in the third part of the paper. To detect the causes of these divergences, the GNSS raw data, recorded during playback and converted to RINEX, was analyzed in terms of reproducibility and compared with the real recorded RINEX data during the field measurements. These investigations show that the distance measurements between the satellites and the receivers already have variances from one playback run to another. Consequently the receiver's internal locating algorithms are not or not only accountable for the variances in the locating solutions. Finally the inphase and quadratur (IQ) data, generated by the RF recorder unit during several playback runs, was evaluated to find out whether the RF generator unit inflicts divergences by itself. The paper closes with a conclusion and an outlook on further investigations to check if the used GNSS signal simulator is suitable for testing GNSS receivers and developing tracking algorithms in traffic telematic scenarios.

J	Chen, S; Guo, SJ; Li, H; Tong, MB; Ji, B				Chen, Si; Guo, Shijun; Li, Hao; Tong, Mingbo; Ji, Bing			Short Landing Performance and Scale Effect of a Flapping Wing Aircraft	JOURNAL OF AEROSPACE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Flapping wing; Unsteady aerodynamic method; Short landing; Descending velocity	UNSTEADY AERODYNAMIC MODEL; KINEMATICS; DESIGN; INSECT; FLIGHT	An investigation was made into the performance and scale effect of birdlike flapping wing aircraft in short landing. A flapping mechanism is proposed to transform a powered shaft rotation to an optimal kinematics of wing motion combining up-and-down stroke, pitching, and fore-and-back swing. An unsteady aerodynamic method (UAM) was developed based on potential flow theory, including the leading- and trailing-edge vortices generated by a flapping wing. After validation based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results, the method is used to calculate the aerodynamic forces of flapping wings. The flight dynamics model of the aircraft is built using Automated Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical Systems (ADAMS) software version 2012 interfacing with the UAM coded in Python. The coupling between the inertial force of the body motion and the aerodynamic forces from flapping wings and tailplane is incorporated into the numerical simulation of the aircraft landing. Taking a 0.196-kg birdlike aircraft model with a prescribed kinematics of flapping wing motion as an example, a parametric study was carried out in a small range of initial tailplane angles and subsequent flapping frequencies. Optimal parameters were obtained to reduce the forward and descending velocities of the aircraft to a minimum value for safe and short landing performance. The study is then extended to aircraft of different geometric scales in a range of 0.5-10 associated with a weight scale of 0.1-1,000. Based on the study, a method is developed to determine the required flapping frequency for birdlike aircraft of different scales to achieve a short landing target with the descending velocity reduced to a specified value. For the aforementioned example aircraft (geometric scale of 1), the flapping frequency is 4 Hz to reduce both descending and forward velocities to 50% of the landing performance in fixed-wing mode, while a birdlike aircraft on a geometric scale of 10 and landing weight of 196 kg requires a minimum flapping frequency of 1.25 Hz to achieve a 50% reduction of the descending and forward velocities compared with the same aircraft landing in fixed-wing mode.
